    "input": "$n$ students attended the first meeting of the Berland SU programming course ($n$ is even). All students will be divided into two groups. Each group will be attending exactly one lesson each week during one of the five working days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday), and the days chosen for the groups must be different. Furthermore, both groups should contain the same number of students.\n\nEach student has filled a survey in which they told which days of the week are convenient for them to attend a lesson, and which are not.\n\nYour task is to determine if it is possible to choose two different week days to schedule the lessons for the group (the first group will attend the lesson on the first chosen day, the second group will attend the lesson on the second chosen day), and divide the students into two groups, so the groups have equal sizes, and for each student, the chosen lesson day for their group is convenient.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) — the number of testcases.\n\nThen the descriptions of $t$ testcases follow.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 1000$) — the number of students.\n\nThe $i$-th of the next $n$ lines contains $5$ integers, each of them is $0$ or $1$. If the $j$-th integer is $1$, then the $i$-th student can attend the lessons on the $j$-th day of the week. If the $j$-th integer is $0$, then the $i$-th student cannot attend the lessons on the $j$-th day of the week.\n\nAdditional constraints on the input: for each student, at least one of the days of the week is convenient, the total number of students over all testcases doesn't exceed $10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each testcase print an answer. If it's possible to divide the students into two groups of equal sizes and choose different days for the groups so each student can attend the lesson in the chosen day of their group, print \"YES\" (without quotes). Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without quotes).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\n\nInput\n2\n4\n1 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0 1\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0\n2\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1 0\nOutput\nYES\nNO\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first testcase, there is a way to meet all the constraints. For example, the first group can consist of the first and the third students, they will attend the lessons on Thursday (the fourth day); the second group can consist of the second and the fourth students, and they will attend the lessons on Tuesday (the second day).\n\nIn the second testcase, it is impossible to divide the students into groups so they attend the lessons on different days.",

    "input": "'Jeopardy!' is an intellectual game where players answer questions and earn points. Company Q conducts a simplified 'Jeopardy!' tournament among the best IT companies. By a lucky coincidence, the old rivals made it to the finals: company R1 and company R2. \n\nThe finals will have n questions, m of them are auction questions and n - m of them are regular questions. Each question has a price. The price of the i-th question is a_{i} points. During the game the players chose the questions. At that, if the question is an auction, then the player who chose it can change the price if the number of his current points is strictly larger than the price of the question. The new price of the question cannot be less than the original price and cannot be greater than the current number of points of the player who chose the question. The correct answer brings the player the points equal to the price of the question. The wrong answer to the question reduces the number of the player's points by the value of the question price.\n\nThe game will go as follows. First, the R2 company selects a question, then the questions are chosen by the one who answered the previous question correctly. If no one answered the question, then the person who chose last chooses again.\n\nAll R2 employees support their team. They want to calculate what maximum possible number of points the R2 team can get if luck is on their side during the whole game (they will always be the first to correctly answer questions).

    "input": "'Twas the night before Christmas, and Santa's frantically setting up his new Christmas tree! There are n nodes in the tree, connected by n-1 edges. On each edge of the tree, there's a set of Christmas lights, which can be represented by an integer in binary representation.\n\n<image>\n\nHe has m elves come over and admire his tree. Each elf is assigned two nodes, a and b, and that elf looks at all lights on the simple path between the two nodes. After this, the elf's favorite number becomes the [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of the values of the lights on the edges in that path.\n\nHowever, the North Pole has been recovering from a nasty bout of flu. Because of this, Santa forgot some of the configurations of lights he had put on the tree, and he has already left the North Pole! Fortunately, the elves came to the rescue, and each one told Santa what pair of nodes he was assigned (a_i, b_i), as well as the parity of the number of set bits in his favorite number. In other words, he remembers whether the number of 1's when his favorite number is written in binary is odd or even.\n\nHelp Santa determine if it's possible that the memories are consistent, and if it is, remember what his tree looked like, and maybe you'll go down in history!\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers, n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the size of tree and the number of elves respectively.\n\nThe next n-1 lines of each test case each contains three integers, x, y, and v (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n; -1 ≤ v < 2^{30}) — meaning that there's an edge between nodes x and y. If \n\n  * v = -1: Santa doesn't remember what the set of lights were on for this edge. \n  * v ≥ 0: The set of lights on the edge is v. \n\n\n\nThe next m lines of each test case each contains three integers, a, b, and p (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n; a ≠ b; 0 ≤ p ≤ 1) — the nodes that the elf was assigned to, and the parity of the number of set bits in the elf's favorite number.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of all n and the sum of all m don't exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5 each.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, first print either YES or NO (in any case), whether there's a tree consistent with Santa's memory or not. \n\nIf the answer is YES, print n-1 lines each containing three integers: x, y, and v (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n; 0 ≤ v < 2^{30}) — the edge and the integer on that edge.

This is correct because: \n\n  * The first elf goes from node 2 to node 3. This elf's favorite number is 4, so he remembers the value 1 (as 4 has an odd number of 1 bits in its binary representation). \n  * The second elf goes from node 2 to node 5. This elf's favorite number is 3, so he remembers the value 0 (as 3 has an even number of 1 bits in its binary representation). \n  * The third elf goes from node 5 to node 6. This elf's favorite number is 7, so he remembers the value 1 (as 7 has an odd number of 1 bits in its binary representation). \n  * The fourth elf goes from node 6 to node 1. This elf's favorite number is 1, so he remembers the value 1 (as 1 has an odd number of 1 bits in its binary representation). \n  * The fifth elf goes from node 4 to node 5. This elf's favorite number is 4, so he remembers the number 1 (as 4 has an odd number of 1 bits in its binary representation). \n\n\n\nNote that there are other possible answers.",

    "input": "**Last Supper**\n\nLeonardo was very active when working on the Last Supper, his most famous mural painting: one of his first daily tasks was that of deciding which tempera colors to use during the rest of the working day. He needed many colors but could only keep a limited number of them on his scaffold. His assistant was in charge, among other things, of climbing up the scaffold to deliver colors to him and then getting down to put them back on the suitable shelf on the floor.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem Background & Strategy**\n\nIn this task, you will need to write two separate programs to help the assistant. The first program will receive Leonardo’s instructions (a sequence of colors Leonardo will need during the day), and create a **short string of bits**, called **advice**.  \nWhile processing Leonardo’s requests during the day, the assistant will not have access to Leonardo’s future requests, only to the advice produced by your first program.  \nThe second program will receive the advice, and then receive and process Leonardo’s requests in an online fashion (i.e., one at a time). This program must be able to understand what the advice means and use it to make optimal choices.\n\n---\n\n### **Moving colors between shelf and scaffold**\n\nWe will consider a simplified scenario. Suppose that there are **N** colors numbered from 0 to N−1, and that each day Leonardo asks the assistant for a new color exactly N times.  \nLet **C** be the sequence of the N color requests made by Leonardo. Thus we may think of C as a sequence of N numbers, each being between 0 and N−1, inclusive.  \nNote that some colors might not occur in C at all, and others may appear multiple times.\n\nThe scaffold is always full and contains some **K** of the N colors, with K < N. Initially, the scaffold contains the colors from 0 to K−1, inclusive.\n\n---\n\n### **Assistant’s behavior & optimal strategy**\n\nThe assistant processes Leonardo’s requests one at a time.  \nWhenever the requested color is **already on the scaffold**, the assistant can rest.  \nOtherwise, he has to pick up the requested color from the shelf and move it to the scaffold.  \nOf course, there is no room on the scaffold for the new color, so the assistant must then choose one of the colors on the scaffold and take it from the scaffold back to the shelf.\n\n#### Leonardo’s optimal strategy\n\n- If there is a color on the scaffold that will never be needed in the future, remove it.\n- Otherwise, remove the color that will **next be needed furthest in the future**.\n\nThis guarantees the assistant can rest as often as possible.\n\n---\n\n### **Example 1**\n\nLet **N = 4**, colors = [0, 1, 2, 3], requests **C = [2, 0, 3, 0]**, **K = 2**  \nInitial scaffold: [0, 1]\n\nSteps:\n1. Request 2 → not on scaffold → remove 1 → scaffold: [0, 2]\n2. Request 0 → on scaffold → rest\n3. Request 3 → remove 0 → scaffold: [3, 2]\n4. Request 0 → remove 2 → scaffold: [3, 0]\n\nOptimal strategy: in step 3, should have removed 2, allowing a rest in step 4.\n\n---\n\n### **Assistant’s strategy when memory is limited**\n\nLeonardo doesn’t let the assistant keep the request sequence C. The assistant only gets to **read and remember part of it**, and must encode it as an advice sequence **A**, with at most **M bits**.\n\n---\n\n### **Example 2**\n\nScaffold states encoded as 2 bits each.  \nFor scaffold transitions: [0,1] → [0,2] → [0,2] → [3,2] → [3,0]  \nA = (0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0)\n\n---\n\n### **Statement**\n\nYou must write **two programs**:\n\n1. **ComputeAdvice(C, N, K, M)** → writes A using `WriteAdvice(bit)`\n2. **Assist(A, N, K, R)** → reads `GetRequest()` and uses `PutBack(color)`\n\n---\n\n### **Example 3**\n\nGiven `A = (0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0)`, the calls would be:\n\n```c\nWriteAdvice(0)\nWriteAdvice(0)\nWriteAdvice(1)\n...\nWriteAdvice(0)\n```\n\nThen `Assist` is called, processes `N = 4` requests, and uses `PutBack` when needed.\n\n| GetRequest() | Action      |\n|--------------|-------------|\n| 2            | PutBack(1)  |\n| 0            | -           |\n| 3            | PutBack(0)  |\n| 0            | PutBack(2)  |\n\n---\n\n### **Implementation Details**\n\nTwo files: `advisor.c/cpp/pas` and `assistant.c/cpp/pas`\n\n- `ComputeAdvice(C, N, K, M)`\n- `WriteAdvice(unsigned char a)`\n- `Assist(A, N, K, R)`\n- `PutBack(int T)`\n- `int GetRequest()`\n\n---\n\n### **Compilation & Grading**\n\n- Include `advisor.h` or `assistant.h`\n- Pascal: use `advisorlib`, `assistantlib`\n- Grader input:\n  - Line 1: `N K M`\n  - Lines 2 to N+1: `C[i]`\n- Time limit: 2 sec\n- Memory limit: 256 MiB\n\n\n\nDo note that you DO NOT necessarily have to solve for the general case, but only for the subproblem defined by the following constraints:",

He now wants to solve them and so he visits the practice page to view these [problems]. \n\nGiven a list of N contest codes, where each contest code is either START38 or LTIME108, help Chef count how many problems were featured in each of the contests. \n\n------ Input Format ------ \n\n- First line will contain T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\n- Each test case contains of two lines of input.\n- First line of input contains the total count of problems that appeared in the two recent contests - N.\n- Second line of input contains the list of N contest codes. Each code is either START38 or LTIME108, to which each problem belongs.\n\n------ Output Format ------ \n\nFor each test case, output two integers in a single new line - the first integer should be the number of problems in START38, and the second integer should be the number of problems in LTIME108.\n\n------ Constraints ------ \n\n$1 ≤ T ≤ 10$\n$1 ≤ N ≤ 1000$\n- Each of the contest codes will be either START38 or LTIME108.\n\n----- Sample Input 1 ------ \n4\n3\nSTART38 LTIME108 START38\n4\nLTIME108 LTIME108 LTIME108 START38\n2\nLTIME108 LTIME108\n6\nSTART38 LTIME108 LTIME108 LTIME108 START38 LTIME108\n\n----- Sample Output 1 ------ \n2 1\n1 3\n0 2\n2 4\n\n----- explanation 1 ------ \nTest case $1$: There are $2$ START38s in the input, which means that there were $2$ problems in START38. Similarly, there was $1$ problem in LTIME108.\n\nTest case $2$: There is $1$ START38 in the input, which means that there was $1$ problem in START38. Similarly, there were $3$ problems in LTIME108.\n\nTest case $3$: There are no START38s in the input, which means that were $0$ problems in START38. Similarly, there were $2$ problems in LTIME108.\n\nTest case $4$: There are $2$ START38s in the input, which means that there were $2$ problems in START38.
