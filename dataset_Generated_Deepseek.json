At this point, there is sufficient information to conclude that town $2$ has at most one outgoing road.\nTherefore, the procedure may also return $2$.\n\n### Example 2\n\nConsider a scenario in which there are $5$ towns and the roads connecting the towns are illustrated by the following image:\n\n\nThe procedure `find_town` is called in the following way:\n\n```\nfind_town(5)\n```\n\nIn this scenario, there is no town with at most one outgoing road.\nTherefore, the procedure should return $-1$.\n\n\n## Constraints\n* $3 \\le N \\le 2000$\n\nIn this subtask you can obtain a partial score.\nLet $Q$ be the maximum number of calls to the procedure `check_road` across all test cases in this subtask.\nYour score for this subtask is calculated according to the following table:\n\n| Condition                   | Points                                  |\n| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| $20\\,000 \\lt Q \\le 40\\,000$ | $20$                                    |\n| $8000 \\lt Q \\le 20\\,000$    | $90 - 70 \\sqrt{\\frac{Q - 8000}{12000}}$ |\n| $Q \\le 8000$                | $90$                                    |\n\n\n## Grading\n\nIn some test cases, the behaviour of the grader is adaptive.\nThis means that in these test cases the grader does not have a fixed configuration of road directions.\nInstead, the answers given by the grader may depend on the questions asked by your solution.\nIt is guaranteed that the grader answers in such a way that after each answer there is at least one configuration of road directions consistent with all the answers given so far.\n\n\n## Sample Grader\n\nThe sample grader reads an array $R$ of $N$ strings with $N$ characters representing the roads in Indonesia.\nFor each $i$ and $j$ such that $0 \\le i, j \\le N - 1$ ($i \\ne j$), $R[i][j]$ is `1` if there is a road going from town $i$ to town $j$ and $R[i][j]$ is `0` if there is a road going from town $j$ to town $i$.\nFor each $i$ such that $0 \\le i \\le N - 1$, $R[i][i]$ should be `0`.\n\nThe sample grader reads input in the following format:\n\n* line $1$: $N$\n* line $2 + i$ ($0 \\le i \\le N - 1$): $R[i]$\n\nIf the sample grader detects a protocol violation, the output of the sample grader is `Protocol Violation: <MSG>`, where `<MSG>` is one of the following:\n\n* `too many questions`: `check_road` is called more than $40\\;000$ times.\n* `invalid parameters`: `check_road` is called with $A$ and $B$ are not distinct integers from $0$ to $N - 1$ inclusive.\n\nOtherwise, the output of the sample grader is in the following format:\n\n* line $1$: the return value of `find_town`.\n* line $2$: the number of calls to `check_road`.\n\nNote that the sample grader is not adaptive.",

    "input": "# Coreputer\n\nCoreputer, the brand new computing machine has $N$ cores numbered from $0$ to $N-1$. Recent\nmaintenance revealed that some of the cores are malfunctioning. It is unknown which specific\ncores are malfunctioning, but there is *at least one* malfunctioning core.\n\nTo find the malfunctioning cores, Coreputer can run **diagnostic scans**. In each scan, the user tags\na (possibly empty) group of *distinct* cores $T[0], \\ldots, T[l-1]$ for some $0 \\le l \\le N$. The rest of the\ncores are untagged. Coreputer then benchmarks the tagged cores and the untagged ones. Finally,\nit reports which of the two groups contains a greater number of malfunctioning cores, or that the\ntwo groups contain an equal number of malfunctioning cores. Note that an empty group contains\n$0$ malfunctioning cores.\n\nYour task is to find the malfunctioning cores by running diagnostic scans on Coreputer.\n\n## Implementation Details\n\nYou should implement the following procedure.\n\n```\nint[] malfunctioning_cores(int N)\n```\n\n* $N$: the number of cores.\n* This procedure should return an array $c = [c[0], c[1], \\ldots, c[N-1]]$, where for each $i$ from $0$\nto $N-1$, inclusive, $c[i] = 1$ if core $i$ is malfunctioning, and $c[i] = 0$ otherwise.\n* This procedure is called exactly once for each test case.\n\nThe above procedure can make calls to the following procedure:\n\n```\nint run_diagnostic(int[] T)\n```\n\n* $T$: an array of distinct cores.\n* This procedure returns\n  * $1$ if there are more tagged cores than untagged cores which are malfunctioning;\n  * $0$ if the number of tagged and untagged malfunctioning cores are equal;\n  * $-1$ if there are fewer tagged cores than untagged cores which are malfunctioning.\n* This procedure can be called at most 32 times in each test case.\n\nThe grader is **not adaptive**, meaning that the set of malfunctioning cores is fixed before a call to\n`malfunctioning_cores` is made.\n\n## Example\n\nConsider a scenario when there are $N = 4$ cores, and only core 2 is malfunctioning.\n\nProcedure `malfunctioning_cores` is called the following way:\n\n```\nmalfunctioning_cores(4)\n```\n\nThe procedure may call `run_diagnostic` as follows.\n\n| Call | Tagged cores | Untagged cores | Return value |\n|------|--------------|----------------|--------------|\n| `run_diagnostic([0])` | 0 | 1,2,3 | $-1$ |\n| `run_diagnostic([1, 2])` | 1, 2 | 0, 3 | 1 |\n| `run_diagnostic([2])` | 2 | 0, 1, 3 | 1 |\n\nIn the first call, there are no malfunctioning tagged cores, and one untagged core is\nmalfunctioning, so the procedure returns $-1$.\n\nAfter the third call returns 1, it is clear that at least one tagged core (that is, core 2) is\nmalfunctioning. But then, the number of untagged malfunctioning cores must be zero, so we\nconclude that no other core is malfunctioning.\n\nTherefore, the procedure `malfunctioning_cores` should return $[0, 0, 1, 0]$.\n\n## Constraints\n* $2 \\le N \\le 16$\n\nIn this subtask, you can obtain a partial score based on the number of calls to `run_diagnostic`:\n* 50% of points if $24 < q \\le 32$ calls\n* 75% of points if $18 < q \\le 24$ calls\n* 100% of points if $q \\le 18$ calls\n\nIf the calls to the procedure `run_diagnostic` do not conform to the constraints described in Implementation Details, or the return value of `malfunctioning_cores` is incorrect, the score of your solution for that subtask will be 0.\n\n\n## Sample Grader\n\nThe sample grader reads the input in the following format:\n\n* line 1: $N$\n* line 2: $M[0] \\; M[1] \\; \\ldots \\; M[N-1]$\n\nwhere for each $i$ from $0$ to $N-1$, inclusive, $M[i] = 1$ if core $i$ is malfunctioning, and $M[i] = 0$\notherwise.\n\nBefore calling `malfunctioning_cores`, the sample grader checks whether there is at least one\nmalfunctioning core. If this condition is not met, it prints the message `No Malfunctioning\nCores` and terminates.\n\nIf the sample grader detects a protocol violation, the output of the sample grader is `Protocol\nViolation: <MSG>`, where `<MSG>` is one of the error messages:\n\n* `invalid array`: in a call to `run_diagnostic`, array $T$\n  * has more than $N$ elements, or\n  * contains an element that is not an integer between $0$ and $N-1$, inclusive, or\n  * contains the same element at least twice.\n* `too many calls`: the number of calls made to `run_diagnostic` exceeds 32.\n\nOtherwise, let the elements of the array returned by `malfunctioning_cores` be\n$c[0], c[1], \\ldots, c[n-1]$ for some nonnegative $n$.

Each card has one of the letters from A to Y (ASCII 65 to 89) printed on the face, so that each letter appears on exactly two cards. The cards are shuffled into some random order and dealt face down on the table.\n\nJack plays the game by turning two cards face up so the letters are visible. For each of the 25 letters Jack gets a candy from his mother the first time he sees both copies of the letter on the two face up cards. For example, the first time Jack turns over both cards that contain the letter M, he gets a candy. Regardless of whether the letters were equal or not, Jack then turns both cards face down again. The process is repeated until Jack receives 25 candies --- one for each letter.\n\nYou are to implement a procedure `play` that plays the game. Your implementation should call the procedure `faceup(C)` which is implemented by the grader. `C` is a number between 1 and 50 denoting a particular card you wish to be turned face up. The card must not currently be face up. `faceup(C)` returns the character that is printed on the card C.\n\nAfter every second call to `faceup`, the grader automatically turns both cards face down again.\n\nYour procedure `play` may only terminate once Jack has received all 25 candies. It is allowed to make calls to `faceup(C)` even after the moment when Jack gets the last candy.\n\n## Example\nThe following is one possible sequence of calls your procedure `play` could make, with explanations.\n\n| **Call**          | **Returned Value** | **Explanation**                                           |\n|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| `faceup(1)`       | 'B'                | Card 1 contains B.                                        |\n| `faceup(7)`       | 'X'                | Card 7 contains X.

    "input": "# Day 2 Task 2: Traffic Congestion\n\nAlthough Canada is a large country, many areas are uninhabited, and most of the population lives near the southern border. The Trans-Canada Highway, completed in 1962, connects the people living in this strip of land, from St. John's in the East to Victoria in the West, a distance of 7821 km.\n\nCanadians like hockey. After a hockey game, thousands of fans get in their cars and drive home from the game, causing heavy congestion on the roads. A wealthy entrepreneur wants to buy a hockey team and build a new hockey arena. Your task is to help him select a location for the arena to minimize the traffic congestion after a hockey game.\n\nThe country is organized into cities connected by a network of roads. All roads are bidirectional, and there is exactly one *route* connecting any pair of cities. A *route* connecting the cities $c_0$ and $c_k$ is a sequence of distinct cities $c_0, \\dots, c_k$ such that there is a road from $c_{i-1}$ to $c_i$ for each $i$. The new arena must be built in one of the cities, which we will call the *arena city*. After a hockey game, all of the hockey fans travel from the arena city to their home city, except those who already live in the arena city. The amount of congestion on each road is proportional to the number of hockey fans that travel along the road. You must locate the arena city such that the amount of congestion on the most congested road is as small as possible. If there are several equally good locations, you may choose any one.\n\nYou are to implement a procedure `LocateCentre(N, P, S, D)`. $N$ is a positive integer, the number of cities. The cities are numbered from $0$ to $N-1$. $P$ is an array of $N$ positive integers; for each $i$, $P[i]$ is the number of hockey fans living in the city numbered $i$. The total number of hockey fans in all the cities will be at most $2,000,000,000$. $S$ and $D$ are arrays of $N-1$ integers each, specifying the locations of roads. For each $i$, there is a road connecting the two cities whose numbers are $S[i]$ and $D[i]$. The procedure must return an integer, the number of the city that should be the arena city.\n\n## Example\n\nAs an example, consider the network of five cities in the top diagram on the right, where cities $0$, $1$, and $2$ contain $10$ hockey fans each, and cities $3$ and $4$ contain $20$ hockey fans each. The middle diagram shows the congestions when the new arena is in city $2$, the worst congestion being $40$ on the thicker arrow. The bottom diagram shows the congestions when the new arena is in city $3$, the worst congestion being $30$ on the thicker arrow. Therefore, city $3$ would be a better location for the arena than city $2$. The data for this example are in `grader.in.3a`.\n\n![traffic_diagram.png](<image>)\n\n## Note\n\nWe remind contestants that with the given constraints, it is possible to submit a solution that passes Subtask $3$ and fails Subtask $2$. However, remember that your final score for the entire task is determined by **only one** of your submissions.\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n- Implementation folder: `/home/ioi2010-contestant/traffic/`\n- To be implemented by contestant: `traffic.c` or `traffic.cpp` or `traffic.pas`\n- Contestant interface: `traffic.h` or `traffic.pas`\n- Grader interface: `none`\n- Sample grader: `grader.c` or `grader.cpp` or `grader.pas`\n- Sample grader input: `grader.in.1 grader.in.2`\n\n**Note:** The first line of the input file contains $N$. The following $N$ lines contain $P[i]$ for $i$ between $0$ and $N-1$. The following $N-1$ lines contain pairs $S[i]$ and $D[i]$ for $i$ between $0$ and $N-2$.\n\n- Expected output for sample grader input: `grader.expect.1 grader.expect.2` etc.\n- Compile and run (command line): `runc grader.c` or `runc grader.cpp` or `runc grader.pas`\n- Compile and run (gedit plugin): `Control-R`, while editing any implementation file.\n- Submit (command line): `submit grader.c` or `submit grader.cpp` or `submit grader.pas`\n- Submit (gedit plugin): `Control-J`, while editing any implementation or grader file.\n\nDo note that you DO NOT necessarily have to solve for the general case, but only for the subproblem defined by the following constraints: \nMake the same assumptions as in Subtask $1$, but there are at most $1,000,000$ cities.",

    "input": "# Day 2 Task 4: Saveit\n\nThe Xedef Courier Company provides air package delivery among several cities. Some of these cities are **Xedef hubs** where special processing facilities are established. Each of Xedef's aircraft shuttles back and forth between one pair of cities, carrying packages in either direction as required.\n\nTo be shipped from one city to another, a package must be transported by a sequence of hops, where each hop carries the package between a pair of cities served by one of the aircraft. Furthermore, the sequence must include at least one of Xedef's hubs.\n\nTo facilitate routing, Xedef wishes to encode the length of the shortest sequence of hops from every city to every hub on the shipping label of every package. (The length of the shortest sequence leading from a hub to itself is zero.) Obviously, a compact representation of this information is required.\n\nYou are to implement two procedures, `encode(N,H,P,A,B)` and `decode(N,H)`. $N$ is the number of cities and $H$ is the number of hubs. Assume that the cities are numbered from $0$ to $N-1$, and that the hubs are the cities with numbers between $0$ and $H-1$. Further assume that $N \\leq 1000$ and $H \\leq 36$. $P$ is the number of pairs of cities connected by aircraft. All (unordered) pairs of cities will be distinct. $A$ and $B$ are arrays of size $P$, such that the first pair of connected cities is $(A[0], B[0])$, the second pair is $(A[1], B[1])$, and so on.\n\n`encode` must compute a sequence of bits from which `decode` can determine the number of hops from every city to every hub. `encode` will transmit the sequence of bits to the grading server by a sequence of calls to `encode_bit(b)` where $b$ is either $0$ or $1$. `decode` will receive the sequence of bits from the grading server by making calls to `decode_bit`. The $i$-th call to `decode_bit` will return the value of $b$ from the $i$-th call to `encode_bit(b)`. Note that you must ensure that the number of times `decode_bit` will always be at most equal to the number of times `encode` previously called `encode_bit(b)`.\n\nAfter decoding the numbers of hops, `decode` must call `hops(h,c,d)` for every hub $h$ and every city $c$ (including every hub, that is, also for $c=h$), giving the minimum number of hops necessary to ship a package between $h$ and $c$. That is, there must be $N * H$ calls to `hops(h,c,d)`. The order does not matter. You are guaranteed that it is always possible to ship a package between every hub and every city.\n\n**Note:** `encode` and `decode` must communicate only through the specified interface. Shared variables, file access and network access are prohibited. In C or C++, you may declare persistent variables to be `static` to retain information for `encode` or `decode`, while preventing them from being shared. In Pascal, you may declare persistent variables in the `implementation` part of your solution files.\n\n## Example\n\nAs an example, consider the diagram on the right. It shows five cities ($N=5$) connected by seven aircraft ($P=7$). Cities $0$, $1$ and $2$ are hubs ($H=3$). One hop is needed to ship a package between hub $0$ and city $3$, whereas $2$ hops are needed to ship a package between hub $2$ and city $3$. The data for this example are in `grader.in.1`.\n\nThe entries in the following table are all $d$-values that `decode` must deliver by calling `hops(h,c,d)`:\n\n```\n| d             | City c | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |\n|---------------|--------|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Hub h = 0     | 0      | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| Hub h = 1     | 1      | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| Hub h = 2     | 1      | 1 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 2 |\n```\n\n<image>\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n- Implementation folder: `/home/ioi2010-contestant/saveit/`\n- To be implemented by contestant:\n  - `encoder.c` or `encoder.cpp` or `encoder.pas`\n  - `decoder.c` or `decoder.cpp` or `decoder.pas`\n- Contestant interface:\n  - `encoder.h` or `encoder.pas`\n  - `decoder.h` or `decoder.pas`\n- Grader interface: `grader.h` or `graderlib.pas`\n- Sample grader: `grader.c` or `grader.cpp` or `grader.pas and graderlib.pas`\n- Sample grader input: `grader.in.1 grader.in.2 etc.`\n\n**Expected output for sample grader input:**\n- If the implementation is correct for subtask $1$, the output will contain `OK 1`\n- If the implementation is correct for subtask $2$, the output will contain `OK 2`\n- If the implementation is correct for subtask $3$, the output will contain `OK 3`\n- If the implementation is correct for subtask $4$, the output will contain `OK 4`\n\n**Compile and run (command line):**\n- `runc grader.c` or `runc grader.cpp` or `runc grader.pas`\n\n**Compile and run (gedit plugin):**\n- `Control-R`, while editing any implementation file.\n\n**Submit (command line):**\n- `submit grader.c` or `submit grader.cpp` or `submit grader.pas`\n\n**Submit (gedit plugin):**\n- `Control-J`, while editing any implementation or grader file.\n\n\nDo note that you DO NOT necessarily have to solve for the general case, but only for the subproblem defined by the following constraints: \n`encode` must make no more than 360,000 calls to `encode_bit(b)`.",

    "input": "# Deciphering the Mayan Writing\n\nDeciphering the Mayan writing has proven to be a harder task than anticipated by the early investigations. After almost two hundred years, very little of it was actually understood. It has been only in the last three decades that real advances have been made.\n\nMayan writing is based on small drawings known as glyphs which represent sounds. Mayan words are normally written as glyphs put together at various positions.\n\nOne of several problems in deciphering Mayan writing arises in the order of reading. When placing several glyphs in order to form a word, Mayan writers sometimes decided the position based more on their own esthetic views than on any particular rule. This leads to the fact that, even though the sound for many glyphs is known, sometimes archaeologists are not sure how to pronounce a written word.\n\nThe archaeologists are looking for a special word $W$. They know the glyphs for it, but they don’t know all the possible ways of arranging them. Since they knew you were coming to IOI'06, they have asked for your help. They will provide you with the $g$ glyphs from $W$ and a sequence $S$ of all the glyphs (in the order they appear) in the carvings they are studying. Help them by counting the number of possible appearances of the word $W$.\n\n## Task\n\nWrite a program that, given the glyphs for $W$ and the sequence $S$ of glyphs in the carvings, counts the number of possible appearances of $W$ in $S$; that is, every sequence of consecutive $g$ glyphs in $S$ that is a permutation of the glyphs in $W$.\n\n### Constraints\n\n- $1 \\leq g \\leq 3$: the number of glyphs in $W$\n- $g \\leq |S| \\leq 3,000,000$: where $|S|$ is the number of glyphs in the sequence $S$\n\n### Input\n\nYour program must read the following data from the file `writing.in`:\n\n```\nwriting.in DESCRIPTION\n4 11 \ncAda \nAbrAcadAbRa \n```\n\n- **LINE 1:** Contains 2 space-separated integers that represent $g$ and $|S|$.\n- **LINE 2:** Contains $g$ consecutive characters that represent the glyphs in $W$. Valid characters are `'a'-'z'` and `'A'-'Z'`; uppercase and lowercase characters are considered different.\n- **LINE 3:** Contains $|S|$ consecutive characters that represent the glyphs in the carvings. Valid characters are `'a'-'z'` and `'A'-'Z'`; uppercase and lowercase characters are considered different.\n\n### Output\n\nYour program must write the following data to the file `writing.out`:\n\n```\nwriting.out DESCRIPTION\n2\n```\n\n- **LINE 1:** Must contain the count of possible appearances of $W$ in $S$.\n\n### Important Note for Pascal Programmers\n\nBy default in FreePascal, a variable of type `string` has a size limit of 255 characters. If you want to use strings longer than that, you should add the directive `{$H+}` to your code just below the `program ...;` line.\n\n\nDo note that you DO NOT necessarily have to solve for the general case, but only for the subproblem defined by the following constraints:",

Note that $G$ is a subgraph of itself. The following example shows a graph and one of its subgraphs:\n\n![Subgraph Example](<image>)\n\nWe say that a graph $G$ *contains* another graph $H$ if there is at least one subgraph $H'$ of $G$ which is isomorphic to $H$. The following figure shows a graph $G$ that contains the graph $H$.\n\n![Graph Containment Example](<image>)\n\n## TASK\n\nGiven two undirected graphs $G$ and $H$, produce a subgraph $G'$ of $G$ such that:\n\n- the number of vertices in $G$ and $G'$ is the same and\n- $H$ is not contained in $G'$.\n\nNaturally, there may be many subgraphs $G'$ with the above properties. Produce one of those subgraphs with as many edges as possible.\n\n## Base Algorithm\n\nPerhaps the most basic strategy to approach this problem is to consider the edges of $G$ in the order that they are represented in the input file, then attempting to add them one by one to $G'$, verifying at each step whether $H$ is contained in $G'$ or not. The correct implementation of this greedy algorithm will earn some points, but much better strategies exist.\n\n## CONSTRAINTS\n\n- $3 \\leq m \\leq 4$  \n  The number of vertices of $H$.\n- $3 \\leq n \\leq 1000$  \n  The number of vertices of $G$.\n\n## INPUT\n\nYou will be given 10 files `forbidden1.in` to `forbidden10.in` each with the following data:\n\n| **`forbiddenK.in`** | **DESCRIPTION** |\n|---------------------|-----------------|\n| LINE 1: | Contains two space-separated integers, respectively: $m$ and $n$. |\n| NEXT $m$ LINES: | Each line contains $m$ space-separated integers and represents one vertex of $H$ in the order $1, \\dots, m$. The $i$-th element of the $j$-th line in this section is equal to $1$ if vertices $i$ and $j$ are joined by an edge in $H$ and is equal to $0$ otherwise. |\n| NEXT $n$ LINES: | Each line contains $n$ space-separated integers and represents one vertex of $G$ in the order $1, \\dots, n$. The $i$-th element of the $j$-th line in this section is equal to $1$ if vertices $i$ and $j$ are joined by an edge in $G$ and is equal to $0$ otherwise. |\n\nObserve that, except for line 1, the above input represents the adjacency matrices of $H$ and $G$.\n\n## OUTPUT\n\nYou must produce 10 files, one for each of the inputs. Each file must contain the following data:\n\n| **`forbiddenK.out`** | **DESCRIPTION** |\n|----------------------|-----------------|\n| LINE 1: | The file header. The file header must contain `#FILE forbidden K` where $K$ is a number between $1$ and $10$ that corresponds to the input file solved. |\n| LINE 2: | Contains one integer: $n$. |\n| NEXT $n$ LINES: | Each line contains $n$ space-separated integers and represents one vertex of $G'$ in the order $1, \\dots, n$.

Note that there are many possible outputs, and that the above output is correct but not optimal.\n\n## GRADING\n\nYour score will depend on the number of edges in the $G'$ you output. Your score will be determined in the following way: you will receive a non-zero score for each output file only if it meets the task specification. If it does, your score will be calculated as follows.

    "input": "# GARAGE\n**Full Feedback Problem**\n\nA parking garage has $N$ parking spaces, numbered from $1$ to $N$ inclusive. The garage opens empty each morning and operates in the following way throughout the day. Whenever a car arrives at the garage, the attendants check whether there are any parking spaces available. If there are none, then the car waits at the entrance until a parking space is released. If a parking space is available, or as soon as one becomes available, the car is parked in the available parking space. If there is more than one available parking space, the car will be parked at the space with the smallest number. If more cars arrive while some car is waiting, they all line up in a queue at the entrance, in the order in which they arrived.\n\nThe cost of parking in dollars is the weight of the car in kilograms multiplied by the specific rate of its parking space. The cost does not depend on how long a car stays in the garage.\n\nThe garage operator knows that today there will be $M$ cars coming and he knows the order of their arrivals and departures. Help him calculate how many dollars his revenue is going to be today.\n\n## TASK\nWrite a program that, given the specific rates of the parking spaces, the weights of the cars and the order in which the cars arrive and depart, determines the total revenue of the garage in dollars.\n\n## CONSTRAINTS\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 100$  The number of parking spaces\n- $1 \\leq M \\leq 2,000$  The number of cars\n- $1 \\leq R_s \\leq 100$  The rate of parking space $s$ in dollars per kilogram\n- $1 \\leq W_k \\leq 10,000$  The weight of car $k$ in kilograms\n\n## INPUT\nYour program must read from standard input the following data:\n- The first line contains the integers $N$ and $M$, separated by a space.\n- The next $N$ lines describe the rates of the parking spaces. The $s$-th of these lines contains a single integer $R_s$, the rate of parking space number $s$ in dollars per kilogram.\n- The next $M$ lines describe the weights of the cars. The cars are numbered from $1$ to $M$ inclusive in no particular order. The $k$-th of these $M$ lines contains a single integer $W_k$, the weight of car $k$ in kilograms.\n- The next $2 \\times M$ lines describe the arrivals and departures of all cars in chronological order. A positive integer $i$ indicates that car number $i$ arrives at the garage. A negative integer $-i$ indicates that car number $i$ departs from the garage. No car will depart from the garage before it has arrived, and all cars from $1$ to $M$ inclusive will appear exactly twice in this sequence, once arriving and once departing. Moreover, no car will depart the garage before it has parked (i.e., no car will leave while waiting in the queue).\n\n## OUTPUT\nYour program must write to standard output a single line containing a single integer: the total number of dollars that will be earned by the garage operator today.\n\n## EXAMPLES\n\n**Sample Input**\n```\n3 4\n2\n3\n5\n200\n100\n300\n800\n3\n2\n-3\n1\n4\n-4\n-2\n-1\n```\n\n**Sample Output**\n```\n5300\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- Car number $3$ goes to space number $1$ and pays $300 \\times 2 = 600$ dollars.\n- Car number $2$ goes to space number $2$ and pays $100 \\times 3 = 300$ dollars.\n- Car number $1$ goes to space number $1$ (which was released by car number $3$) and pays $200 \\times 2 = 400$ dollars.\n- Car number $4$ goes to space number $3$ (the last remaining) and pays $800 \\times 5 = 4,000$ dollars.\n\n**Sample Input**\n```\n2 4\n5\n2\n100\n500\n1000\n2000\n3\n1\n2\n4\n-1\n-3\n-2\n-4\n```\n\n**Sample Output**\n```\n16200\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- Car number $3$ goes to space number $1$ and pays $1,000 \\times 5 = 5,000$ dollars.\n- Car number $1$ goes to space number $2$ and pays $100 \\times 2 = 200$ dollars.\n- Car number $2$ arrives and has to wait at the entrance.\n- Car number $4$ arrives and has to wait at the entrance behind car number $2$.\n- When car number $1$ releases its parking space, car number $2$ parks there and pays $500 \\times 2 = 1,000$ dollars.\n- When car number $3$ releases its parking space, car number $4$ parks there and pays $2,000 \\times 5 = 10,000$ dollars.\n\nDo note that you DO NOT necessarily have to solve for the general case, but only for the subproblem defined by the following constraints:",

    "input": "# Highway Tolls\n\nIn Japan, cities are connected by a network of highways. This network consists of $N$ cities and $M$ highways. Each highway connects a pair of distinct cities. No two highways connect the same pair of cities. Cities are numbered from $0$ through $N - 1$, and highways are numbered from $0$ through $M - 1$. You can drive on any highway in both directions. You can travel from any city to any other city by using the highways.\n\nA toll is charged for driving on each highway. The toll for a highway depends on the **traffic** condition on the highway. The traffic is either *light* or *heavy*. When the traffic is light, the toll is $A$ yen (Japanese currency). When the traffic is heavy, the toll is $B$ yen. It's guaranteed that $A < B$. Note that you know the values of $A$ and $B$.\n\nYou have a machine which, given the traffic conditions of all highways, computes the smallest total toll that one has to pay to travel between the pair of cities $S$ and $T$ ($S \neq T$), under the specified traffic conditions.\n\nHowever, the machine is just a prototype. The values of $S$ and $T$ are fixed (i.e., hardcoded in the machine) and not known to you. You would like to determine $S$ and $T$. In order to do so, you plan to specify several traffic conditions to the machine, and use the toll values that it outputs to deduce $S$ and $T$. Since specifying the traffic conditions is costly, you don't want to use the machine many times.\n\n## Implementation details\n\nYou should implement the following procedure:\n\n```\nfind_pair(int N, int[] U, int[] V, int A, int B)\n```\n\n- $N$: the number of cities.\n- $U$ and $V$: arrays of length $M$, where $M$ is the number of highways connecting cities. For each $i$ ($0 \\leq i \\leq M - 1$), the highway $i$ connects the cities $U[i]$ and $V[i]$.\n- $A$: the toll for a highway when the traffic is light.\n- $B$: the toll for a highway when the traffic is heavy.\n- This procedure is called exactly once for each test case.\n- Note that the value of $M$ is the length of the arrays, and can be obtained as indicated in the implementation notice.\n\nThe procedure `find_pair` can call the following function:\n\n```\nint64 ask(int[] w)\n```\n\n- The length of $w$ must be $M$. The array $w$ describes the traffic conditions.\n- For each $i$ ($0 \\leq i \\leq M - 1$), $w[i]$ gives the traffic condition on the highway $i$. The value of $w[i]$ must be either $0$ or $1$.\n  - $w[i] = 0$ means the traffic of the highway $i$ is light.\n  - $w[i] = 1$ means the traffic of the highway $i$ is heavy.\n- This function returns the smallest total toll for travelling between the cities $S$ and $T$, under the traffic conditions specified by $w$.\n- This function can be called at most $100$ times (for each test case).\n\n`find_pair` should call the following procedure to report the answer:\n\n```\nanswer(int s, int t)\n```\n\n- $s$ and $t$ must be the pair $S$ and $T$ (the order does not matter).\n- This procedure must be called exactly once.\n\nIf some of the above conditions are not satisfied, your program is judged as **Wrong Answer**. Otherwise, your program is judged as **Accepted** and your score is calculated by the number of calls to `ask` (see Subtasks).\n\n## Example\n\nLet $N = 4$, $M = 4$, $U = [0, 0, 0, 1]$, $V = [1, 2, 3, 2]$, $A = 1$, $B = 3$, $S = 1$, and $T = 3$.\n\nThe grader calls\n\n```\nfind_pair(4, [0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 2, 3, 2], 1, 3).\n```\n\n![<image>](<image>)\n\nIn the figure above, the edge with number $i$ corresponds to the highway $i$. Some possible calls to `ask` and the corresponding return values are listed below:\n\n| **Call**               | **Return** |\n|------------------------|------------|\n| `ask([0, 0, 0, 0])`    | $2$        |\n| `ask([0, 1, 1, 0])`    | $4$        |\n| `ask([1, 0, 1, 0])`    | $5$        |\n| `ask([1, 1, 1, 1])`    | $6$        |\n\nFor the function call `ask([0, 0, 0, 0])`, the traffic of each highway is light and the toll for each highway is $1$. The cheapest route from $S = 1$ to $T = 3$ is $1 \\to 0 \\to 3$. The total toll for this route is $2$. Thus, this function returns $2$.\n\nFor a correct answer, the procedure `find_pair` should call `answer(1, 3)` or `answer(3, 1)`.\n\n## Constraints\n\n- $2 \\leq N \\leq 90,000$\n- $1 \\leq M \\leq 130,000$\n- $1 \\leq A < B \\leq 1,000,000,000$\n- For each $0 \\leq i \\leq M - 1$:\n  - $0 \\leq U[i] \\leq N - 1$\n  - $0 \\leq V[i] \\leq N - 1$\n  - $U[i] \neq V[i]$\n- $(U[i], V[i]) \neq (U[j], V[j])$ and $(U[i], V[i]) \neq (V[j], U[j])$ ($0 \\leq i < j \\leq M - 1$)\n- You can travel from any city to any other city by using the highways.\n- $0 \\leq S \\leq N - 1$\n- $0 \\leq T \\leq N - 1$\n- $S \neq T$\n# Sample grader\n\nThe sample grader reads the input in the following format:\n\n• line 1: N M A B S T  \n• line 2 + i (0 ≤ i ≤ M − 1): U[i] V[i]\n\nIf your program is judged as **Accepted**, the sample grader prints Accepted: q, with q the number of calls to ask.\n\nIf your program is judged as **Wrong Answer**, it prints Wrong Answer: MSG, where MSG is one of:\n\n• answered not exactly once: The procedure answer was not called exactly once.\n• w is invalid: The length of w given to ask is not M or w[i] is neither 0 nor 1 for some i (0 ≤ i ≤ M − 1).\n• more than 100 calls to ask: The function ask is called more than 100 times.\n• {s, t} is wrong: The procedure answer is called with an incorrect pair s and t.\n\n\nDo note that you DO NOT necessarily have to solve for the general case, but only for the subproblem defined by the following constraints: \n$A = 1$, $B = 2$.",

For example, for $N=5$, garden number 12 is the garden `PLPPL`.\n\n### Task\nWrite a program that, given the number of plants $N$ and a string that represents a balanced garden, calculates the number assigned to this garden **modulo some given integer** $M$.\n\nNote that for solving the task, the value of $M$ has no importance other than simplifying computations.\n\n### Constraints\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 1,000,000$\n- $7 \\leq M \\leq 10,000,000$\n\n### Input\nYour program must read from the standard input the following data:\n- Line 1 contains the integer $N$, the number of plants in the garden.\n- Line 2 contains the integer $M$.\n- Line 3 contains a string of $N$ characters `L` (lotus) or `P` (papyrus) that represents a balanced garden.\n\n### Output\nYour program must write to the standard output a single line containing one integer between 0 and $M-1$ (inclusive), the number assigned to the garden described in the input, **modulo** $M$.\n\n### Example\n\n| **Sample input 1** | **Sample output 1** |\n|---------------------|---------------------|\n| 5                  | 5                  |\n| 7                  |                     |\n| PLPPL              |                     |\n\nThe actual number assigned to `PLPPL` is 12. So, the output is $12 \\mod 7$, which is 5.\n\n| **Sample input 2** | **Sample output 2** |\n|---------------------|---------------------|\n| 12                 | 39                 |\n| 10000              |                     |\n| LPLLLPLPPLLL       |                     |\n\n\n\nDo note that you DO NOT necessarily have to solve for the general case, but only for the subproblem defined by the following constraints: \nno additional constraints",

    "input": "# Longest Trip\n\nThe IOI 2023 organizers are in big trouble! They forgot to plan the trip to Ópusztaszer for the upcoming day. \nBut maybe it is not yet too late ...\n\nThere are $N$ landmarks at Ópusztaszer indexed from $0$ to $N-1$. \nSome pairs of these landmarks are connected by *bidirectional* **roads**.\nEach pair of landmarks is connected by at most one road.\nThe organizers *don't know* which landmarks are connected by roads.\n\nWe say that the **density** of the road network at Ópusztaszer is **at least** $\\delta$ if every $3$ distinct landmarks have at least $\\delta$ roads among them.\nIn other words, for each triplet of landmarks $(u, v, w)$ such that $0 \\le u \\lt v \\lt w \\lt N$, among the pairs of landmarks $(u,v), (v,w)$ and $(u,w)$ at least $\\delta$ pairs are connected by a road.\n\nThe organizers *know* a positive integer $D$ such that the density of the road network is at least $D$.\nNote that the value of $D$ cannot be greater than $3$.\n\nThe organizers can make **calls** to the phone dispatcher at Ópusztaszer to gather information about the road connections between certain landmarks.\nIn each call, two nonempty arrays of landmarks $[A[0], \\ldots, A[P-1]]$ and $[B[0], \\ldots, B[R-1]]$ must be specified.\nThe landmarks must be pairwise distinct, that is,\n* $A[i] \\neq A[j]$ for each $i$ and $j$ such that $0 \\le i \\lt j \\lt P$;\n* $B[i] \\neq B[j]$ for each $i$ and $j$ such that $0 \\le i \\lt j \\lt R$;\n* $A[i] \\neq B[j]$ for each $i$ and $j$ such that $0 \\le i \\lt P$ and $0\\le j \\lt R$.\n\nFor each call, the dispatcher reports whether there is a road connecting a landmark from $A$ and a landmark from $B$.\nMore precisely, the dispatcher iterates over all pairs $i$ and $j$ such that $0 \\le i \\lt P$ and $0\\le j \\lt R$.\nIf, for any of them, the landmarks $A[i]$ and $B[j]$ are connected by a road, the dispatcher returns `true`.\nOtherwise, the dispatcher returns `false`.\n\nA **trip** of length $l$ is a sequence of *distinct* landmarks $t[0], t[1], \\ldots, t[l-1]$, \nwhere for each $i$ between $0$ and $l-2$, inclusive, landmark $t[i]$ and landmark $t[i+1]$ are connected by a road.\nA trip of length $l$ is called a **longest trip** if there does not exist any trip of length at least $l+1$.\n\nYour task is to help the organizers to find a longest trip at Ópusztaszer by making calls to the dispatcher.\n\n## Implementation Details\n\nYou should implement the following procedure:\n\n```\nint[] longest_trip(int N, int D)\n```\n\n* $N$: the number of landmarks at Ópusztaszer.\n* $D$: the guaranteed minimum density of the road network.\n* This procedure should return an array $t = [t[0], t[1], \\ldots, t[l-1]]$, representing a longest trip.\n* This procedure may be called **multiple times** in each test case.\n\nThe above procedure can make calls to the following procedure:\n\n```\nbool are_connected(int[] A, int[] B)\n```\n\n* $A$: a nonempty array of distinct landmarks.\n* $B$: a nonempty array of distinct landmarks.\n* $A$ and $B$ should be disjoint.\n* This procedure returns `true` if there is a landmark from $A$ and a landmark from $B$ connected by a road. Otherwise, it returns `false`.\n* This procedure can be called at most $32\\,640$ times in each invocation of `longest_trip`, and at most $150\\,000$ times in total.\n* The total length of arrays $A$ and $B$ passed to this procedure over all of its invocations cannot exceed $1\\,500\\,000$.\n\nThe grader is **not adaptive**. Each submission is graded on the same set of test cases. That is, the values of $N$ and $D$, as well as the pairs of landmarks connected by roads, are fixed for each call of `longest_trip` within each test case.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1\n\nConsider a scenario in which $N = 5$, $D = 1$, and the road connections are as shown in the following figure:\n\n\nThe procedure `longest_trip` is called in the following way:\n```\nlongest_trip(5, 1)\n```\n\nThe procedure may make calls to `are_connected` as follows.\n\nCall                               | Pairs connected by a road |  Return value\n:---------------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:--------------:\n`are_connected([0], [1, 2, 4, 3])` | $(0,1)$ and $(0,2)$       | `true`\n`are_connected([2], [0])`          | $(2,0)$                   | `true`\n`are_connected([2], [3])`          | $(2,3)$                   | `true`\n`are_connected([1, 0], [4, 3])`    | none                      | `false`\n\nAfter the fourth call, it turns out that *none* of the pairs $(1,4)$, $(0,4)$, $(1,3)$ and $(0,3)$ is connected by a road.\nAs the density of the network is at least $D = 1$, we see that from the triplet $(0, 3, 4)$, the pair $(3,4)$ must be connected by a road.\nSimilarly to this, landmarks $0$ and $1$ must be connected.\n\nAt this point, it can be concluded that $t = [1, 0, 2, 3, 4]$ is a trip of length $5$, and that there does not exist a trip of length greater than $5$.\nTherefore, the procedure `longest_trip` may return $[1, 0, 2, 3, 4]$.\n\nConsider another scenario in which $N = 4$, $D = 1$, and the roads between the landmarks are as shown in the following figure:\n\n\nThe procedure `longest_trip` is called in the following way:\n```\nlongest_trip(4, 1)\n```\n\nIn this scenario, the length of a longest trip is $2$. Therefore, after a few calls to procedure `are_connected`, the procedure `longest_trip` may return one of $[0, 1]$, $[1, 0]$, $[2, 3]$ or $[3, 2]$.\n\n### Example 2\n\nSubtask 0 contains an additional example test case with $N=256$ landmarks.\nThis test case is included in the attachment package that you can download from the contest system.\n\n## Constraints\n* $3 \\le N \\le 256$\n* The sum of $N$ over all calls to `longest_trip` does not exceed $1\\,024$ in each test case.\n* $D = 1$\n* Your score is determined based on the number of calls to procedure `are_connected` over a single invocation of `longest_trip`.\n* Let $q$ be the maximum number of calls among all invocations of `longest_trip` over every test case of the subtask.\n* Your score is calculated according to the following table:\n  * $2\\,750 \\lt q \\le 32\\,640$: $20$ points\n  * $550 \\lt q \\le 2\\,750$: $30$ points\n  * $400 \\lt q \\le 550$: $45$ points\n  * $q \\le 400$: $60$ points\n\nIf the calls to the procedure `are_connected` do not conform to the constraints described in Implementation Details, or the array returned by `longest_trip` is incorrect, the score of your solution for that subtask will be $0$.\n\n\n## Sample Grader\n\nLet $C$ denote the number of scenarios, that is, the number of calls to `longest_trip`.\nThe sample grader reads the input in the following format:\n\n* line $1$: $C$\n\nThe descriptions of $C$ scenarios follow.\n\nThe sample grader reads the description of each scenario in the following format:\n\n* line $1$: $N \\; D$\n* line $1 + i$ ($1 \\le i \\lt N$): $U_i[0] \\; U_i[1] \\; \\ldots \\; U_i[i-1]$\n\nHere, each $U_i$ ($1 \\le i \\lt N$) is an array of size $i$, describing which pairs of landmarks are connected by a road.\nFor each $i$ and $j$ such that $1 \\le i \\lt N$ and $0 \\le j \\lt i$:\n* if landmarks $j$ and $i$ are connected by a road, then the value of $U_i[j]$ should be $1$;\n* if there is no road connecting landmarks $j$ and $i$, then the value of $U_i[j]$ should be $0$.\n\n<!-- IMPORTANT NOTE TO TRANSLATORS: THE FOLLOWING MESSAGES (IN BACKTICKS) SHOULD NOT BE TRANSLATED -->\n\nIn each scenario, before calling `longest_trip`, the sample grader checks whether the density of the road network is at least $D$.\nIf this condition is not met, it prints the message `Insufficient Density` and terminates.\n\nIf the sample grader detects a protocol violation, the output of the sample grader is `Protocol Violation: <MSG>`, where `<MSG>` is one of the following error messages:\n\n* `invalid array`: in a call to `are_connected`, at least one of arrays $A$ and $B$\n    - is empty, or\n    - contains an element that is not an integer between $0$ and $N-1$, inclusive, or\n    - contains the same element at least twice.\n* `non-disjoint arrays`: in a call to `are_connected`, arrays $A$ and $B$ are not disjoint.\n* `too many calls`: the number of calls made to `are_connected` exceeds $32\\,640$ over the current invocation of `longest trip`, or exceeds $150\\,000$ in total.\n* `too many elements`: the total number of landmarks passed to `are_connected` over all calls exceeds $1\\,500\\,000$.\n\n\nOtherwise, let the elements of the array returned by `longest_trip` in a scenario be $t[0], t[1], \\ldots, t[l - 1]$ for some nonnegative $l$.\nThe sample grader prints three lines for this scenario in the following format:\n\n* line $1$: $l$\n* line $2$: $t[0] \\; t[1] \\; \\ldots \\; t[l-1]$\n* line $3$: the number of calls to `are_connected` over this scenario\n\nFinally, the sample grader prints:\n\n* line $1 + 3 \\cdot C$: the maximum number of calls to `are_connected` over all calls to `longest_trip`",

1$ consisting of the card numbers left on the table in that order.\n* This procedure should return the card number discarded by Pak Ganesh.\n* This procedure is called exactly $Q$ times.\n\nEach test case involves a single scenario of $N$ and $K$.\nA program that calls the above procedures is run exactly two times, as follows.\n\nDuring the first run of the program:\n\n* `init_assistant` is called exactly once before any calls to `choose_cards`;\n* `choose_cards` is called exactly $Q$ times.\n  In each call, the returned chosen cards are stored in the grading system.\n\nDuring the second run of the program:\n\n* `init_magician` is called exactly once before any calls to `find_discarded_card`;\n* `find_discarded_card` is called exactly $Q$ times.\n  In each call, an **arbitrary** play of the trick is chosen, and the cards returned by `choose_cards` are used as the inputs to `find_discarded_card`.\n\nIn particular, any information saved to static or global variables in the first run of the program\nis not available in the second run of the program.\n\n\n## Example\n\nConsider the following call:\n\n```\ninit_assistant(5, 3)\n```\n\nThere are $5$ cards that will be used in all tricks, each will invite a spectator to choose $3$ distinct cards.\n\nAfter initialization has been done by Pak Ganesh, consider the following call:\n\n```\nchoose_cards([1, 2, 3])\n```\n\nThis means the spectator chose cards numbered $1$, $2$, and $3$.\nAssume Pak Ganesh discarded card number $1$ and left card number $3$ before card number $2$ on the table, then `choose_cards` should return $[3, 2]$.\n\nConsider another possible call:\n\n```\nchoose_cards([1, 3, 4])\n```\n\nThis means the spectator chose cards numbered $1$, $3$, and $4$.\nAssume Pak Ganesh discarded card number $3$ and left card number $1$ before card number $4$ on the table, then `choose_cards` should return $[1, 4]$.\n\nAssume Pak Ganesh has left the cards on the table for all plays and consider the following call:\n\n```\ninit_magician(5, 3)\n```\n\nThe same information of $N$ and $K$ as Pak Ganesh is given to Pak Dengklek.\n\nAfter initialization has been done by Pak Dengklek, consider the following call:\n\n```\nfind_discarded_card([1, 4])\n```\n\nThis means Pak Dengklek sees card numbers $1$ and $4$ in that order on the table.\nThese cards are the same as the return value of `choose_cards([1, 3, 4])`.\nAs Pak Ganesh discarded card number $3$ in that play, then `find_discarded_card` should return $3$.\n\nConsider another call:\n\n```\nfind_discarded_card([3, 2])\n```\n\nThis means Pak Dengklek sees card numbers $3$ and $2$ in that order on the table.\nThese cards are the same as the return value of `choose_cards([1, 2, 3])`.\nAs Pak Ganesh discarded card number $1$ in that play, then `find_discarded_card` should return $1$.\n\n\n## Constraints\n* $2 \\le K \\le 8$\n* $K \\le N \\le 10\\,000$\n* $1 \\le Q \\le 50\\,000$\n\nFor each call to `choose_cards`:\n\n* $1 \\le cards[i] \\le N$ (for each $i$ such that $0 \\le i \\le K - 1$).\n* All the elements of $cards$ are distinct.\n\nFor each call to `find_discarded_card`:\n\n* All the inputs given are the same as all $Q$ return values of `choose_cards` in random order.\n* $K = 8$\n\n\n## Sample Grader\n\nThe sample grader reads the input in the following format:\n\n* line $1$: $N \\; K \\; Q$\n* line $2 + i$ ($0 \\le i \\le Q - 1$): the $K$ cards chosen by the spectator for play $i$ in increasing order.\n\nFor each play in the same order as input, the sample grader prints\n`Accepted: chosen_cards = <chosen_cards>; discarded_card = <discarded_card>` if the trick is played correctly, where\n`<chosen_cards>` is the cards returned by `choose_cards` and\n`<discarded_card>` is the card returned by `find_discarded_card`.\n\nFor each play, the sample grader prints `Wrong Answer: <MSG>` if the trick is failed to be played correctly, where `<MSG>` is one of the following:\n- `invalid number of chosen cards`: the number of cards returned by `chosen_cards` is incorrect.\n- `invalid chosen card number`: any of the card numbers returned by `chosen_cards` is invalid.\n- `duplicated chosen cards`: there exist two cards returned by `chosen_cards` with the same number.\n- `wrong discarded card`: the card returned by `find_discarded_card` is not correct.",

    "input": "# POI Full Feedback Problem\n\n## Introduction\nThe local Plovdiv Olympiad in Informatics (POI) was held according to the following unusual rules. There were $N$ contestants and $T$ tasks. Each task was graded with only one test case, therefore for every task and every contestant there were only two possibilities: either the contestant solved the task, or the contestant did not solve the task. There was no partial scoring on any task.\n\nThe number of points assigned to each task was determined after the contest and was equal to the number of contestants that did not solve the task. The score of each contestant was equal to the sum of points assigned to the tasks solved by that contestant.\n\nPhilip participated in the contest, but he is confused by the complicated scoring rules, and now he is staring at the results, unable to determine his place in the final standings. Help Philip by writing a program that calculates his score and his ranking.\n\nBefore the contest, the contestants were assigned unique IDs from $1$ to $N$ inclusive. Philip's ID was $P$. The final standings of the competition list the contestants in descending order of their scores. In case of a tie, among the tied contestants, those who have solved more tasks will be listed ahead of those who have solved fewer tasks. In case of a tie by this criterion as well, the contestants with equal results will be listed in ascending order of their IDs.\n\n## Task\nWrite a program that, given which problems were solved by which contestant, determines Philip's score and his rank in the final standings.\n\n## Constraints\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 2,000$  \n  The number of contestants  \n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 2,000$  \n  The number of tasks  \n- $1 \\leq P \\leq N$  \n  Philip's ID\n\n## Input\nYour program must read from standard input the following data:\n- The first line contains the integers $N$, $T$ and $P$, separated by individual spaces.\n- The next $N$ lines describe which tasks were solved by which contestant. The $k$th of these lines describes which tasks were solved by the contestant with ID $k$. Each such line contains $T$ integers, separated by spaces. The first of these numbers denotes whether or not contestant $k$ solved the first task. The second number denotes the same for the second task and so on. These $T$ numbers are all either $0$ or $1$, where $1$ means that contestant $k$ solved the corresponding task, and $0$ means that he or she did not solve it.\n\n## Output\nYour program must write to standard output a single line with two integers separated by a single space. First, the score that Philip got on the POI competition. Second, Philip's rank in the final standings. The rank is an integer between $1$ and $N$ inclusive, with $1$ denoting the contestant listed at the top (i.e., a contestant who has the highest score) and $N$ to the one listed at the bottom (i.e., a contestant with the lowest score).\n\n## Example\n| **Sample Input** | **Sample Output** |\n|-------------------|-------------------|\n| 5 3 2             | 3 2               |\n| 0 0 1             |                   |\n| 1 1 0             |                   |\n| 1 0 0             |                   |\n| 1 1 0             |                   |\n| 1 1 0             |                   |\n\n## Explanation\nThe first problem was unsolved by only one contestant, so it is worth $1$ point. The second problem was unsolved by two contestants, so it is worth $2$ points. The third problem was unsolved by four contestants, so it is worth $4$ points. Thus the first contestant has a score of $4$; the second contestant (Philip), the fourth and the fifth contestants all have a score of $3$; and the third contestant has a score of $1$. Contestants $2$, $4$ and $5$ are all tied according to the first tie-break rule (number of problems solved), and according to the second tie-break rule (smaller ID) Philip ranks before the others. Thus Philip's rank in the final standings is $2$. He is only behind the contestant with ID $1$.\n\nDo note that you DO NOT necessarily have to solve for the general case, but only for the subproblem defined by the following constraints:",

To play it, choose two integers greater than two and call them $g$ and $r$. Then draw four points at the vertices of a square making the top two points green and the bottom two points red. Draw green points and red points inside the square taking care that no three points, including the four initial ones, are in the same line. Continue until the total number of green points equals $g$ and the total number of red points equals $r$.  \n\nAfter the board is drawn, start joining points. Any two points can be joined by a line segment as long as:\n\n- The two points to be joined are of the same color, and  \n- The line segment joining the points does not intersect any other previously drawn line segment (other than at the endpoints).  \n\nTwo points $u$ and $v$ are said to be in the same *component* if it is possible to traverse from point $u$ to point $v$ using the line segments already drawn.  \n\nYou win the game if you get all the green points in one component using exactly $g-1$ line segments, and all the red points in another component using exactly $r-1$ line segments. **It can be proven that if the points are drawn as described above, then there is always a way to win the game.**  \n\nYou will be given a square board of size $s$ with $g$ green and $r$ red points whose coordinates are represented by integer pairs $(x_i, y_i)$. Green points are numbered from $1$ to $g$ with the top-left point at $(0, s)$ being $1$, the top-right at $(s, s)$ being $2$, and interior points ranging from $3$ to $g$ in arbitrary order. Red points are numbered from $1$ to $r$ with the bottom-left point at $(0, 0)$ being $1$, the bottom-right at $(s, 0)$ being $2$, and interior points ranging from $3$ to $r$ in arbitrary order.  \n\n![<image>](<image>)  \n\nThe figure shows a sample game: all the green points are joined into one component, and all the red points are joined into another component.  \n\nYou can see that no three points are in the same line, and that no two line segments intersect each other except at their endpoints.  \n\n## TASK  \nWrite a program that, given the coordinates of the $g$ green points and the coordinates of the $r$ red points, decides how to draw $g-1$ green line segments and $r-1$ red line segments so that all of the green points are in the same component, all of the red points are in another component, and no two line segments intersect each other.  \n\n### CONSTRAINTS  \n\n- $3 \\leq g \\leq 50,000$  \n- $3 \\leq r \\leq 50,000$  \n- $0 < s \\leq 200,000,000$  \n\n## INPUT  \nYour program must read the following data from the file `points.in`:  \n\n| **points.in** | **DESCRIPTION** |  \n|---------------|-----------------|  \n| LINE 1:       | Contains the integer $g$. |  \n| NEXT $g$ LINES: | Each line contains two space-separated integers that represent the coordinates $x_i$ and $y_i$ of each of the $g$ green points, starting from $1$ to $g$. |  \n| LINE $g+2$:   | Contains integer $r$. |  \n| NEXT $r$ LINES: | Each line contains two space-separated integers that represent the coordinates $x_i$ and $y_i$ of each of the $r$ red points, starting from $1$ to $r$. |  \n\n## OUTPUT  \nYour program must write the following data to the file `points.out`:  \n\n| **points.out** | **DESCRIPTION** |  \n|---------------|-----------------|  \n|               | Your output file must contain $(g-1) + (r-1)$ lines, one for every line segment drawn to join points. |  \n|               | Each line must contain three space-separated entities: two integers and a character.

    "input": "# RAISINS\n\nPlovdiv's famous master chocolatier Bonny needs to cut a slab of chocolate with raisins. The chocolate is a rectangular block of identical square pieces. The pieces are aligned with the edges of the chocolate, and they are arranged in $N$ rows and $M$ columns, for a total of $N \\times M$ pieces. Each piece has one or more raisins on it, and no raisins lie between or across pieces.\n\n<image>\n\nInitially, the chocolate is one single, monolithic block. Bonny needs to cut it into smaller and smaller blocks until finally she has cut the chocolate down to its $N \\times M$ individual pieces. As Bonny is very busy, she needs the help of her assistant, Sly Peter, to do the cutting. Peter only makes straight line, end-to-end cuts and he wants to be paid for every single cut he makes. Bonny has no money at hand, but she has plenty of raisins left over, so she offers to pay Peter in raisins. Sly Peter agrees to this arrangement, but under the following condition: every time he cuts a given block of chocolate into two smaller blocks, he has to be paid as many raisins as there are on the block he was given.\n\nBonny wants to pay Peter as little as possible. She knows how many raisins there are on each of the $N \\times M$ pieces. She can choose the order in which she gives Peter any remaining blocks, and she can also tell Peter what cuts to make (horizontal or vertical) and where exactly to make them. Help Bonny decide how to cut the chocolate into individual pieces, so that she pays Sly Peter as few raisins as possible.\n\n## TASK\nWrite a program that, given the number of raisins on each of the individual pieces, determines the minimum number of raisins that Bonny would have to pay Sly Peter.\n\n## CONSTRAINTS\n- $1 \\leq N, M \\leq 50$ (The number of pieces on each side of the chocolate)\n- $1 \\leq R_{k,p} \\leq 1000$ (The number of raisins on the piece in the $k$th row and the $p$th column)\n\n## INPUT\nYour program must read from standard input the following data:\n- The first line contains the integers $N$ and $M$, separated by a single space.\n- The next $N$ lines describe how many raisins there are on each piece of the chocolate. The $k$th of these $N$ lines describes the $k$th row of the chocolate. Each such line contains $M$ integers separated by single spaces. The integers describe the pieces on the corresponding row in order from left to right. The $p$th integer on the $k$th line (among these $N$ lines) tells you how many raisins are on the piece in the $k$th row and the $p$th column.\n\n## OUTPUT\nYour program must write to standard output a single line containing a single integer: the minimum possible number of raisins that Bonny would have to pay Sly Peter.\n\n## EXAMPLE\n| **Sample Input** | **Sample Output** |\n|------------------|------------------|\n| 2 3             | 77               |\n| 2 7 5           |                  |\n| 1 9 5           |                  |\n\nOne possible way (out of many) to achieve a cost of 77 is as follows:\n\n```\n2 7 5      2 7 | 5       2 7 | 5       2 | 7 | 5       2 | 7 | 5       2 | 7 | 5\n1 9 5  ->  1 9 | 5  ->   1 9 | 5  ->    1 9 | 5  ->     1 | 9 | 5  ->   1 | 9 | 5\n```\n\nThe first cut that Bonny asks Peter to make separates the third column from the rest of the chocolate. Bonny needs to pay Peter 29 raisins for this.\n\nThen Bonny gives Peter the smaller of the two blocks: the one that has two pieces with 5 raisins each, and asks Peter to cut the block in two in exchange for 10 raisins.\n\nAfter this, Bonny gives Peter the largest remaining block: the one having pieces with 2, 7, 1 and 9 raisins respectively.

Finally, Bonny asks Peter to split the bottom-left block, paying 10 raisins.\n\nThe total cost to Bonny is $29 + 10 + 19 + 9 + 10 = 77$ raisins.

    "input": "# Rarest Insects\n\nThere are $N$ insects, indexed from $0$ to $N - 1$, running around Pak Blangkon's house.\nEach insect has a **type**, which is an integer between $0$ and $10^9$ inclusive.\nMultiple insects may have the same type.\n\nSuppose insects are grouped by type.\nWe define the cardinality of the **most frequent** insect type as the number of insects in a group with the most number of insects.\nSimilarly, the cardinality of the **rarest** insect type is the number of insects in a group with the least number of insects.\n\nFor example, suppose that there are $11$ insects, whose types are $[5, 7, 9, 11, 11, 5, 0, 11, 9, 100, 9]$.\nIn this case, the cardinality of the **most frequent** insect type is $3$. The groups with the most number of insects are type $9$ and type $11$, each consisting of $3$ insects.\nThe cardinality of the **rarest** insect type is $1$. The groups with the least number of insects are type $7$, type $0$, and type $100$, each consisting of $1$ insect.\n\nPak Blangkon does not know the type of any insect.\nHe has a machine with a single button that can provide some information about the types of the insects.\nInitially, the machine is empty.\nTo use the machine, three types of operations can be performed:\n1. Move an insect to inside the machine.\n1. Move an insect to outside the machine.\n1. Press the button on the machine.\n\nEach type of operation can be performed at most $40\\;000$ times.\n\nWhenever the button is pressed, the machine reports the cardinality of the **most frequent** insect type, considering only insects inside the machine.\n\nYour task is to determine the cardinality of the **rarest** insect type among all $N$ insects in Pak Blangkon's house by using the machine.\nAdditionally, in some subtasks, your score depends on the maximum number of operations of a given type that are performed (see Subtasks section for details).\n\n\n## Implementation Details\n\nYou should implement the following procedure:\n\n```\nint min_cardinality(int N)\n```\n\n* $N$: the number of insects.\n* This procedure should return the cardinality of the **rarest** insect type among all $N$ insects in Pak Blangkon's house.\n* This procedure is called exactly once.\n\nThe above procedure can make calls to the following procedures:\n\n```\nvoid move_inside(int i)\n```\n\n* $i$: the index of the insect to be moved inside the machine.

    "input": "# Robot Contest\n\nAI researchers at the University of Szeged are holding a robot programming contest.\nYour friend, Hanga, has decided to take part in the contest. The objective is to program the ultimate _Pulibot_, admiring the great intelligence of the famous Hungarian herding dog breed, the Puli.\n\nPulibot will be tested on a maze consisting of a $(H+2) \\times (W+2)$ grid of cells.\nThe rows of the grid are numbered from $-1$ to $H$ from north to south and the columns of the grid are numbered from $-1$ to $W$ from west to east.\nWe refer to the cell located at row $r$ and column $c$ of the grid ($-1 \\le r \\le H$, $-1 \\le c \\le W$) as cell $(r, c)$.\n\nConsider a cell $(r,c)$ such that $0 \\le r \\lt H$ and $0 \\le c \\lt W$. There are $4$ cells **adjacent** to cell $(r,c)$:\n* cell $(r,c-1)$ is referred to as the cell **west** of cell $(r,c)$;\n* cell $(r+1,c)$ is referred to as the cell **south** of cell $(r,c)$;\n* cell $(r,c+1)$ is referred to as the cell **east** of cell $(r,c)$;\n* cell $(r-1,c)$ is referred to as the cell **north** of cell $(r,c)$.\n\nCell $(r,c)$ is called a **boundary** cell of the maze if $r=-1$ or $r=H$ or $c=-1$ or $c=W$ holds.\nEach cell that is not a boundary cell of the maze is either an **obstacle** cell or an **empty** cell.\nAdditionally, each empty cell has a **color**, represented by a nonnegative integer between $0$ and $Z_{MAX}$, inclusive.\nInitially, the color of each empty cell is $0$.\n\nFor example, consider a maze with $H=4$ and $W=5$, containing a single obstacle cell $(1,3)$:\n\n\nThe only obstacle cell is denoted by a cross. Boundary cells of the maze are shaded.\nThe numbers written to each empty cell represent their respective colors.\n\nA **path** of length $\\ell$ ($\\ell \\gt 0$) from cell $(r_0, c_0)$ to cell $(r_\\ell, c_\\ell)$ \nis a sequence of pairwise distinct *empty* cells $(r_0,c_0), (r_1, c_1), \\ldots, (r_\\ell, c_\\ell)$ \nin which for each $i$ ($0 \\le i \\lt \\ell$) the cells $(r_i, c_i)$ and $(r_{i+1}, c_{i+1})$ are\nadjacent.\n\nNote that a path of length $\\ell$ contains exactly $\\ell+1$ cells.\n\nAt the contest, the researchers set up a maze in which there exists at least one path from cell $(0,0)$ to cell $(H-1, W-1)$. \nNote that this implies that cells $(0, 0)$ and $(H-1, W-1)$ are guaranteed to be empty.\n\nHanga does not know which cells of the maze are empty and which cells are obstacles.\n\nYour task is to help Hanga to program Pulibot so that it is capable of finding a *shortest path* (that is, a path of minimum length) from cell $(0,0)$ to cell $(H-1, W-1)$ in the unknown maze set up by the researchers.\nThe specification of Pulibot and the rules of the contest are described below.\n\n### Pulibot's Specification\n\nDefine the **state** of a cell $(r,c)$ for each $-1 \\le r \\le H$ and $-1 \\le c \\le W$ as an integer so that:\n* if cell $(r,c)$ is a boundary cell then its state is $-2$;\n* if cell $(r,c)$ is an obstacle cell then its state is $-1$;\n* if cell $(r,c)$ is an empty cell then its state is the color of the cell.\n\nPulibot's program is executed as a sequence of steps.\nIn each step, Pulibot recognizes the states of nearby cells and then performs an instruction.\nThe instruction it performs is determined by the recognized states.\nA more precise description follows.\n\nSuppose that at the beginning of the current step, Pulibot is at cell $(r,c)$, which is an empty cell.\nThe step is performed as follows:\n\n1. First, Pulibot recognizes the current **state array**, that is, the array $S = [S[0], S[1], S[2], S[3], S[4]]$, consisting of the state of cell $(r,c)$ and of all adjacent cells:\n    * $S[0]$ is the state of cell $(r,c)$.\n    * $S[1]$ is the state of the cell to the west.\n    * $S[2]$ is the state of the cell to the south.\n    * $S[3]$ is the state of the cell to the east.\n    * $S[4]$ is the state of the cell to the north.\n1. Then, Pulibot determines the **instruction** $(Z, A)$ which corresponds to the recognized state array.\n1. Finally, Pulibot performs that instruction: it sets the color of cell $(r, c)$ to color $Z$\nand then it performs action $A$, which is one of the following actions:\n    * *stay* at cell $(r,c)$;\n    * *move* to one of the $4$ adjacent cells;\n    * *terminate the program*.\n\nFor example, consider the scenario displayed on the left of the following figure.\nPulibot is currently at cell $(0, 0)$ with the color $0$.\nPulibot recognizes the state array $S = [0, -2, 2, 2, -2]$.\nPulibot may have a program which, upon recognizing this array, sets the color of the current cell to $Z = 1$ and then moves to the east,\nas displayed in the middle and on the right of the figure:\n\n\n### Robot Contest Rules\n\n* At the start, Pulibot is placed at cell $(0,0)$ and begins to execute its program.\n* Pulibot is not allowed to move to a cell which is not empty.\n* Pulibot's program must terminate after at most $500\\,000$ steps.\n* After the termination of Pulibot's program, empty cells in the maze should be colored such that:\n  - There exists a shortest path from $(0,0)$ to $(H-1, W-1)$ for which the color of each cell included in the path is $1$.\n  - The color of every other empty cell is $0$.\n* Pulibot may terminate its program at any empty cell.\n  \nFor example, the following figure shows a possible maze with $H = W = 6$.\nThe starting configuration is displayed on the left and the expected coloring of empty cells after termination is displayed on the right:\n\n\n\n## Implementation Details\n\nYou should implement the following procedure.\n\n```\nvoid program_pulibot()\n```\n\n* This procedure should produce Pulibot's program. This program should work correctly for all values of $H$ and $W$ and any maze which meets the task constraints.\n* This procedure is called exactly once for each test case.\n\nThis procedure can make calls to the following procedure to produce Pulibot's program:\n\n```\nvoid set_instruction(int[] S, int Z, char A)\n```\n\n* $S$: array of length $5$ describing a state array.\n* $Z$: a nonnegative integer representing a color.\n* $A$: a single character representing an action of Pulibot as follows:\n    - `H`: stay;\n    - `W`: move to the west;\n    - `S`: move to the south;\n    - `E`: move to the east;\n    - `N`: move to the north;\n    - `T`: terminate the program.\n* Calling this procedure instructs Pulibot that upon recognizing state $S$ it should perform the instruction $(Z, A)$.\n\nСalling this procedure multiple times with the same state $S$ will result in an `Output isn’t correct` verdict.\n\nIt is not required to call `set_instruction` with each possible state array $S$. However, if Pulibot later recognizes a state for which an instruction was not set, you will get an `Output isn’t correct` verdict.\n\nAfter `program_pulibot` completes, the grader invokes Pulibot's program over one or more mazes.\nThese invocations do *not* count towards the time limit for your solution.\nThe grader is *not* adaptive, that is, the set of mazes is predefined in each test case.\n\nIf Pulibot violates any of the Robot Contest Rules before terminating its program, you will get an `Output isn’t correct` verdict.\n\n## Example\n\nThe procedure `program_pulibot` may make calls to `set_instruction` as follows:\n\nCall                                         | Instruction for state array $S$\n:-------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------:\n`set_instruction([0, -2, -1, 0, -2], 1, E)`  | Set color to $1$ and move east\n`set_instruction([0, 1, -1, 0, -2], 1, E)`   | Set color to $1$ and move east\n`set_instruction([0, 1, 0, -2, -2], 1, S)`   | Set color to $1$ and move south\n`set_instruction([0, -1, -2, -2, 1], 1, T)`  | Set color to $1$ and terminate program\n\nConsider a scenario where $H=2$ and $W=3$, and the maze is displayed in the following figure.\n\n\nFor this particular maze Pulibot's program runs in four steps. The state arrays Pulibot recognizes \nand the instructions it performs correspond exactly to the four calls to `set_instruction` made\nabove, in order. The last of these instructions terminates the program.\n\nThe following figure shows the state of the maze before each of the four steps and its final state after termination.\n\n\nHowever, do note that this program of $4$ instructions might not find a shortest path in other valid mazes.\nTherefore, if submitted, it will receive an `Output isn’t correct` verdict.\n\n## Constraints\n$Z_{MAX} = 19$. Hence, Pulibot can use colors from 0 to 19, inclusive.\n\nFor each maze used to test Pulibot:\n* $2 \\le H, W \\le 15$\n* There is at least one path from cell $(0,0)$ to cell $(H-1, W-1)$.\n\nYour score depends on the number of colors used in Pulibot's program.\nDenote by $Z^\\star$ the maximum value of $Z$ over all calls made to `set_instruction`.\nThe score is calculated according to the following table:\n\n| Condition               | Score (complete)      | Score (partial)       |\n|:-----------------------:|:---------------------:|:---------------------:|\n| $11 \\le Z^\\star \\le 19$ | $20 + (19 - Z^\\star)$ | $12 + (19 - Z^\\star)$ |\n| $Z^\\star = 10$          | $31$                  | $23$                  |\n| $Z^\\star = 9$           | $34$                  | $26$                  |\n| $Z^\\star = 8$           | $38$                  | $29$                  |\n| $Z^\\star = 7$           | $42$                  | $32$                  |\n| $Z^\\star \\le 6$         | $46$                  | $36$                  |\n\n\n## Sample Grader\n\nThe sample grader reads the input in the following format:\n* line $1$: $H \\; W$\n* line $2 + r$ ($0 \\le r \\lt H$): $m[r][0] \\; m[r][1] \\; \\ldots \\; m[r][W-1]$\n\nHere, $m$ is an array of $H$ arrays of $W$ integers, describing the non-boundary cells of the maze.\n$m[r][c] = 0$ if cell $(r, c)$ is an empty cell and $m[r][c] = 1$ if cell $(r, c)$ is an obstacle cell.\n\n<!-- IMPORTANT NOTE TO TRANSLATORS: THE FOLLOWING MESSAGES (IN BACKTICKS) SHOULD NOT BE TRANSLATED -->\n\nThe sample grader first calls `program_pulibot()`.\nIf the sample grader detects a protocol violation, the sample grader prints\n`Protocol Violation: <MSG>` and terminates, where `<MSG>` is one of the following error messages:\n\n* `Invalid array`: $-2 \\le S[i] \\le Z_{MAX}$ is not met for some $i$ or the length of $S$ is not $5$.\n* `Invalid color`: $0 \\le Z \\le Z_{MAX}$ is not met.\n* `Invalid action`: character $A$ is not one of `H`, `W`, `S`, `E`, `N` or `T`. \n* `Same state array`: `set_instruction` was called with the same array $S$ at least twice.\n\nOtherwise, when `program_pulibot` completes, the sample grader executes Pulibot's program in the maze described by the input.\n\nThe sample grader produces two outputs.\n\nFirst, the sample grader writes a log of Pulibot's actions to the file `robot.bin` in the working directory.\nThis file serves as the input of the visualization tool described in the following section.\n\nSecond, if Pulibot's program does not terminate successfully, the sample grader prints one of the following error messages:\n\n* `Unexpected state`: Pulibot recognized a state array which `set_instruction` was not called with.\n* `Invalid move`: performing an action resulted in Pulibot moving to a nonempty cell.\n* `Too many steps`: Pulibot performed $500\\,000$ steps without terminating its program.\n\nOtherwise, let $e[r][c]$ be the state of cell $(r, c)$ after Pulibot’s program terminates.\nThe sample grader prints $H$ lines in the following format:\n* Line $1 + r$ ($0 \\le r \\lt H$): $e[r][0] \\; e[r][1] \\; \\ldots \\; e[r][W-1]$\n\n\n## Display Tool\n\nThe attachment package for this task contains a file named `display.py`.\nWhen invoked, this Python script displays Pulibot's actions in the maze described by the input of the sample grader.\nFor this, the binary file `robot.bin` must be present in the working directory.\n\nTo invoke the script, execute the following command.\n```\npython3 display.py\n```\n\nA simple graphical interface shows up. The main features are as follows:\n\n* You can observe the status of the full maze. The current location of Pulibot is highlighted by a rectangle.\n* You can browse through the steps of Pulibot by clicking the arrow buttons or pressing their hotkeys. You can also jump to a specific step.\n* The upcoming step in Pulibot's program is shown at the bottom.\nIt shows the current state array and the instruction it will perform.\nAfter the final step, it shows either one of the error messages of the grader, or `Terminated` if the program successfully terminates.\n* To each number that represents a color, you can assign a visual background color, as well as a display text. The display text is a short string that shall be written to each cell having the same color. You can assign background colors and display texts in either of the following ways:\n  - Set them in a dialog window after clicking on the `Colors` button.\n  - Edit the contents of the `colors.txt` file.\n* To reload `robot.bin`, use the `Reload` button. It is useful if the contents of `robot.bin` have changed.",

    "input": "# Seats\n\nYou are going to hold an international programming contest in a rectangular hall, which has $HW$ seats arranged in $H$ rows and $W$ columns. The rows are numbered from $0$ through $H - 1$ and the columns are numbered from $0$ through $W - 1$. The seat in row $r$ and column $c$ is denoted by $(r, c)$. You invited $HW$ contestants, numbered from $0$ through $HW - 1$. You also made a seating chart, which assigns the contestant $i$ $(0 \\leq i \\leq HW - 1)$ to the seat $(R_i, C_i)$. The chart assigns exactly one contestant to each seat.\n\nA set of seats in the hall $S$ is said to be **rectangular** if there are integers $r_1, r_2, c_1$, and $c_2$ satisfying the following conditions:\n\n- $0 \\leq r_1 \\leq r_2 \\leq H - 1$.\n- $0 \\leq c_1 \\leq c_2 \\leq W - 1$.\n- $S$ is exactly the set of all seats $(r, c)$ such that $r_1 \\leq r \\leq r_2$ and $c_1 \\leq c \\leq c_2$.\n\nA rectangular set consisting of $k$ seats $(1 \\leq k \\leq HW)$ is **beautiful** if the contestants whose assigned seats are in the set have numbers from $0$ through $k - 1$. The **beauty** of a seating chart is the number of beautiful rectangular sets of seats in the chart.\n\nAfter preparing your seating chart, you receive several requests to swap two seats assigned to two contestants. More precisely, there are $Q$ such requests numbered from $0$ through $Q - 1$ in chronological order. The request $j$ $(0 \\leq j \\leq Q - 1)$ is to swap the seats assigned to contestants $A_j$ and $B_j$. You accept each request immediately and update the chart. After each update, your goal is to compute the beauty of the current seating chart.\n\n## Implementation details\n\nYou should implement the following procedure and function:\n\n```\ngive_initial_chart(int H, int W, int[] R, int[] C)\n```\n\n- $H, W$: the number of rows and the number of columns.\n- $R, C$: arrays of length $HW$ representing the initial seating chart.\n- This procedure is called exactly once, and before any call to `swap_seats`.\n\n```\nint swap_seats(int a, int b)\n```\n\n- This function describes a request to swap two seats.\n- $a, b$: contestants whose seats are to be swapped.\n- This function is called $Q$ times.\n- This function should return the beauty of the seating chart after the swap.\n\n## Example\n\nLet $H = 2$, $W = 3$, $R = [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]$, $C = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]$, and $Q = 2$.\n\nThe grader first calls\n\n```\ngive_initial_chart(2, 3, [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]).\n```\n\nAt first, the seating chart is as follows.\n\n```\n[[0, 3, 4],\n [1, 2, 5]]\n```\n\nLet's say the grader calls `swap_seats(0, 5)`. After the request $0$, the seating chart is as follows.\n\n```\n[[5, 3, 4],\n [1, 2, 0]]\n```\n\nThe sets of seats corresponding to the contestants `{0}`, `{0, 1}`, and `{0, 1, 2}` are rectangular and beautiful. Thus, the beauty of this seating chart is $3$, and `swap_seats` should return $3$.\n\nLet's say the grader calls `swap_seats(0, 5)` again. After the request $1$, the seating chart goes back to the initial state. The sets of seats corresponding to the contestants `{0}`, `{0, 1}`, `{0, 1, 2, 3}`, and `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}` are rectangular and beautiful. Hence, the beauty of this seating chart is $4$, and `swap_seats` should return $4$.\n\nThe files `sample-01-in.txt` and `sample-01-out.txt` in the zipped attachment package correspond to this example. Other sample inputs/outputs are also available in the package.\n\n## Constraints\n\n- $1 \\leq H$\n- $1 \\leq W$\n- $HW \\leq 1,000,000$\n- $0 \\leq R_i \\leq H - 1 \\ (0 \\leq i \\leq HW - 1)$\n- $0 \\leq C_i \\leq W - 1 \\ (0 \\leq i \\leq HW - 1)$\n- $(R_i, C_i) \neq (R_j, C_j) \\ (0 \\leq i < j \\leq HW - 1)$\n- $1 \\leq Q \\leq 50,000$\n- $0 \\leq a \\leq HW - 1$ for any call to `swap_seats`\n- $0 \\leq b \\leq HW - 1$ for any call to `swap_seats`\n- $a \neq b$ for any call to `swap_seats`\n\n## Sample grader\n\nThe sample grader reads the input in the following format:\n\n- line 1: $H \\ W \\ Q$\n- line 2 + $i$ $(0 \\leq i \\leq HW - 1)$: $R_i \\ C_i$\n- line 2 + $HW + j$ $(0 \\leq j \\leq Q - 1)$: $A_j \\ B_j$\n\nHere, $A_j$ and $B_j$ are parameters for the call to `swap_seats` for the request $j$.\n\nThe sample grader prints your answers in the following format:\n\n- line $1 + j$ $(0 \\leq j \\leq Q - 1)$: the return value of `swap_seats` for the request $j$.\n\n\nDo note that you DO NOT necessarily have to solve for the general case, but only for the subproblem defined by the following constraints: \nHW \\leq 10,000, Q \\leq 5,000",
