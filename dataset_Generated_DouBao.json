    "input": "\"Fukusekiken\" is a popular ramen shop where you can line up. But recently, I've heard some customers say, \"I can't afford to have vacant seats when I enter the store, even though I have a long waiting time.\" I'd like to find out why such dissatisfaction occurs, but I'm too busy to check the actual procession while the shop is open. However, since I know the interval and number of customers coming from many years of experience, I decided to analyze the waiting time based on that.\n\nThere are 17 seats in the store facing the counter. The store opens at noon, and customers come as follows.\n\n* 100 groups from 0 to 99 will come.\n* The i-th group will arrive at the store 5i minutes after noon.\n* The number of people in the i-th group is 5 when i% 5 is 1, and 2 otherwise.\n(x% y represents the remainder when x is divided by y.)\n* The i-th group finishes the meal in 17 (i% 2) + 3 (i% 3) + 19 minutes when seated.\n\n\n\nThe arrival times, number of people, and meal times for the first 10 groups are as follows:\n\nGroup number | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9\n--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---\nArrival time (minutes later) | 0 | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 35 | 40 | 45\nNumber of people (people) | 2 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 2\nMeal time (minutes) | 19 | 39 | 25 | 36 | 22 | 42 | 19 | 39 | 25 | 36\n\n\n\nIn addition, when guiding customers to their seats, we do the following.\n\n* Seats are numbered from 0 to 16.\n* A group of x people can only be seated when there are x open seats in a row.\n\n\n\nAlso, if there are multiple places to sit, sit in the place with the lowest seat number. For example, if only seats 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 are available, a group of 5 people cannot be seated. If you are in a group of two, you will be seated at number 0 and 1.\n\n* Once you are seated, you will not be asked to move your seat.\n* Customers come and go in 1 minute increments. At each time, we will guide customers in the following order.\n1. The next group can be seated at the same time as the previous group leaves.\n2. When seating customers, seat as many groups as possible at the same time, starting with the group at the top of the line. It does not overtake the order of the matrix. In other words, if the first group cannot be seated, even if other groups in the procession can be seated, they will not be seated.\n3. Groups arriving at that time will line up at the end of the procession, if any. If there is no line and you can sit down, you will be seated, and if you cannot, you will wait in line. As an example, the following shows how the first 10 groups arrive. From left to right, the three columns in each row show the time, seating, and queue. For seats, the \"\" is vacant and the number indicates that the group with that number is sitting in that seat.\n\n\n\n\nTime: Seat procession\n0: 00 :\n5: 0011111 :\n10: 001111122 :\n15: 00111112233:\n18: 00111112233:\n19: 111112233:\n20: 44111112233 :\n25: 4411111223355:\n30: 4411111223355: 66666 Group 6 arrives\n34: 4411111223355: 66666\n35: 4411111__3355: 6666677 Group 7 arrives\n40: 4411111__3355: 666667788 Group 8 arrives\n41: 4411111__3355: 666667788\n42: 11111__3355__: 666667788\n43: 11111__3355__: 666667788\n44: 6666677883355___: Groups 6, 7 and 8 are seated\n45: 666667788335599__: Group 9 arrives and sits down\n\n\nFor example, at time 40, the eighth group arrives, but cannot be seated and joins the procession. The fourth group eats until time 41. At time 42, seats in the 4th group are available, but the 6th group is not yet seated due to the lack of consecutive seats. The first group eats until time 43. At time 44, the first group will be vacant, so the sixth group will be seated, and at the same time the seventh and eighth groups will be seated. The ninth group arrives at time 45 and will be seated as they are available.\n\nBased on this information, create a program that outputs the time (in minutes) that the nth group of customers waits by inputting an integer n that is 0 or more and 99 or less.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nGiven multiple datasets. Each dataset consists of one integer n.\n\nThe number of datasets does not exceed 20.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each dataset, print the minute wait time (integer greater than or equal to 0) for the nth customer on a single line.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\n\nOutput\n\n0\n14\n9\n4",

    "input": "\"If you didn't copy assignments during your engineering course, did you even do engineering?\"\nThere are $Q$ students in Chef's class. Chef's teacher has given the students a simple assignment:\nWrite a function that takes as arguments an array $A$ containing only unique elements and a number $X$ guaranteed to be present in the array and returns the ($1$-based) index of the element that is equal to $X$.\nThe teacher was expecting a linear search algorithm, but since Chef is such an amazing programmer, he decided to write the following binary search function:\ninteger binary_search(array a, integer n, integer x):\ninteger low, high, mid\nlow := 1\nhigh := n\nwhile low ≤ high:\nmid := (low + high) / 2\nif a[mid] == x:\nbreak\nelse if a[mid] is less than x:\nlow := mid+1\nelse:\nhigh := mid-1\nreturn mid\n\nAll of Chef's classmates have copied his code and submitted it to the teacher.\nChef later realised that since he forgot to sort the array, the binary search algorithm may not work. Luckily, the teacher is tired today, so she asked Chef to assist her with grading the codes. Each student's code is graded by providing an array $A$ and an integer $X$ to it and checking if the returned index is correct. However, the teacher is lazy and provides the exact same array to all codes. The only thing that varies is the value of $X$.\nChef was asked to type in the inputs.

    "input": "# Stations (stations)\n\nSingapore's Internet Backbone (SIB) consists of n stations, which are assigned indices from 0 to n − 1. There are also n − 1 bidirectional links, numbered from 0 to n − 2. Each link connects two distinct stations. Two stations connected with a single link are called neighbours.\n\nA path from station x to station y is a sequence of distinct stations a₀, a₁, · · · , aₚ, such that a₀ = x, aₚ = y, and every two consecutive stations in the path are neighbours. There is exactly one path from any station x to any other station y.\n\nAny station x can create a packet (a piece of data) and send it to any other station y, which is called the packet's target. This packet must be routed along the unique path from x to y as follows. Consider a station z that currently holds a packet, whose target station is y (z ≠ y). In this situation station z:\n\n1. executes a routing procedure that determines the neighbour of z which is on the unique path from z to y, and\n2. forwards the packet to this neighbour.\n\nHowever, stations have limited memory and do not store the entire list of the links in SIB to use it in the routing procedure.\n\nYour task is to implement a routing scheme for SIB, which consists of two procedures.\n\nThe first procedure is given n, the list of the links in the SIB and an integer k ≥ n − 1 as the inputs. It assigns each station a unique integer label between 0 and k, inclusive.\n\nThe second procedure is the routing procedure, which is deployed to all stations after labels are assigned. It is given only the following inputs:\n* s, the label of the station that currently holds a packet,\n* t, the label of the packet's target station (t ≠ s),\n* c, the list of the labels of all neighbours of s.\n\nIt should return the label of the neighbour of s that the packet should be forwarded to.\n\nIn one subtask, the score of your solution depends on the value of the maximum label assigned to any station (in general, smaller is better).\n\n## Implementation details\n\nYou should implement the following procedures:\n\n```\nint[] label(int n, int k, int[] u, int[] v)\n```\n\n* n: number of stations in the SIB.\n* k: maximum label that can be used.\n* u and v: arrays of size n − 1 describing the links. For each i (0 ≤ i ≤ n − 2), link i connects stations with indices u[i] and v[i].\n* This procedure should return a single array L of size n. For each i (0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1) L[i] is the label assigned to station with index i. All elements of array L must be unique and between 0 and k, inclusive.\n\n```\nint find_next_station(int s, int t, int[] c)\n```\n\n* s: label of the station holding a packet.\n* t: label of the packet's target station.\n* c: an array giving the list of the labels of all neighbours of s. The array c is sorted in ascending order.\n* This procedure should return the label of a neighbour of s that the packet should be forwarded to.\n\nEach test case involves one or more independent scenarios (i.e., different SIB descriptions). For a test case involving r scenarios, a program that calls the above procedures is run exactly two times, as follows.\n\nDuring the first run of the program:\n* label procedure is called r times,\n* the returned labels are stored by the grading system, and\n* find_next_station is not called.\n\nDuring the second run of the program:\n* find_next_station may be called multiple times. In each call, an arbitrary scenario is chosen, and the labels returned by the call to label procedure in that scenario are used as the inputs to find_next_station.\n* label is not called.\n\nIn particular, any information saved to static or global variables in the first run of the program is not available within find_next_station procedure.\n\n## Example\n\nConsider the following call:\n\n```\nlabel(5, 10, [0, 1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 3, 4])\n```\n\nThere are a total of 5 stations, and 4 links connecting pairs of stations with indices (0, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3) and (2, 4). Each label can be an integer from 0 to k = 10.\n\nIn order to report the following labelling:\n\n| Index | Label |\n|-------|-------|\n| 0     | 6     |\n| 1     | 2     |\n| 2     | 9     |\n| 3     | 3     |\n| 4     | 7     |\n\nthe label procedure should return [6, 2, 9, 3, 7]. The numbers in the following figure show the indices (left panel) and assigned labels (right panel).\n\nAssume the labels have been assigned as described above and consider the following call:\n\n```\nfind_next_station(9, 6, [2, 7])\n```\n\nThis means that the station holding the packet has label 9, and the target station has label 6. The labels of stations on the path to the target station are [9, 2, 6]. Hence, the call should return 2, which is the label of the station that the packet should be forwarded to (which has index 1).\n\nConsider another possible call:\n\n```\nfind_next_station(2, 3, [3, 6, 9])\n```\n\nThe procedure should return 3, since the target station with label 3 is a neighbour of the station with label 2, and hence should receive the packet directly.\n\n## Constraints\n* $1 \\le r \\le 10$\n\nFor each call to label:\n* $2 \\le n \\le 1000$\n* $k \\ge n - 1$\n* $0 \\le u[i], v[i] \\le n - 1$ (for all $0 \\le i \\le n - 2$)\n\nFor each call to find_next_station, the input comes from an arbitrarily chosen previous call to label. Consider the labels it produced. Then:\n* $s$ and $t$ are labels of two different stations.\n* $c$ is the sequence of all labels of neighbours of the station with label $s$, in ascending order.\n\nFor each test case, the total length of all arrays $c$ passed to the procedure find_next_station does not exceed $100\\,000$ for all scenarios combined.\n* $k = 10^9$\n\nIn this subtask you can obtain a partial score. Let $m$ be the maximum label value returned by label across all scenarios. Your score for this subtask is calculated according to the following table:\n\n| Maximum label | Score |\n|---------------|-------|\n| $m \\ge 10^9$      | 0     |\n| $2000 \\le m < 10^9$ | $50 \\cdot \\log_{5000}(10^9/m)$ |\n| $1000 < m < 2000$ | 50    |\n| $m \\le 1000$      | 61    |\n\n\n## Sample grader\n\nThe sample grader reads the input in the following format:\n\n* line 1: r\nr blocks follow, each describing a single scenario. The format of each block is as follows:\n* line 1: n k\n* line 2 + i (0 ≤ i ≤ n − 2): u[i] v[i]\n* line 1 + n: q: the number of calls to find_next_station.\n* line 2 + n + j (0 ≤ j ≤ q − 1): z[j] y[j] w[j]: indices of stations involved in the j-th call to find_next_station. The station z[j] holds the packet, the station y[j] is the packet's target, and the station w[j] is the station that the packet should be forwarded to.\n\nThe sample grader prints the result in the following format:\n\n* line 1: m\nr blocks corresponding to the consecutive scenarios in the input follow. The format of each block is as follows:\n* line 1 + j (0 ≤ j ≤ q − 1): index of the station, whose label was returned by the j-th call to find_next_station in this scenario.\n\nNote that each run of the sample grader calls both label and find_next_station.",

A convex polygon has the property that for any two points $X$ and $Y$ of the polygon, the line segment connecting $X$ and $Y$ is inside the polygon. All polygons in this task are convex polygons with at least two vertices, and all vertices in a polygon are different and have integer coordinates. No three vertices of the polygon are collinear. The word \\\"polygon\\\" below always refers to such polygons.\n\nGiven two polygons $A$ and $B$, the Minkowski sum of $A$ and $B$ consists of all the points of the form $(x_1 + x_2, y_1 + y_2)$ where $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point in $A$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is a point in $B$. It turns out that the Minkowski sum of polygons is also a polygon. The figure below shows an example: two triangles and their Minkowski sum.\n\n![<image>](minkowski_sum_example.png)\n\nWe study a reverse operation to the Minkowski sum. For a given polygon $P$, we are looking for two polygons $A$ and $B$ such that:\n\n- $P$ is the Minkowski sum of $A$ and $B$,\n- $A$ has from 2 to 4 different vertices, i.e., it is a segment (2 vertices), a triangle (3 vertices), or a quadrilateral (4 vertices),\n- $A$ should have as many vertices as possible, i.e.:\n  - $A$ should be a quadrilateral, if possible,\n  - if $A$ cannot be a quadrilateral, it should be a triangle, if possible,\n  - otherwise it should be a segment.\n\nClearly, neither $A$ nor $B$ can be equal to $P$ because then the other summand would have to be a point, which is not a valid polygon.\n\nYou are given a set of input files, each containing a description of a polygon $P$. For each input file, you should find the polygons $A$ and $B$ as required above, and create an output file containing descriptions of $A$ and $B$. For the given input files, such polygons $A$ and $B$ can always be found. If there are many correct results, you should find and output one of them. You should not submit any programs, just the output files.\n\n### Input\n\nYou are given 10 problem instances in the text files named `polygon1.in` to `polygon10.in`, where the number after `polygon` is the input number. Each input file is organized as follows. The first line contains one integer $N$: the number of vertices of the polygon $P$. The following $N$ lines describe the vertices in a counter-clockwise order, one vertex per line. Line $i+1$ (for $i = 1, 2, \\dots, N$) contains two integers $X_i$ and $Y_i$, separated by a space: coordinates of the $i$th vertex of the polygon. All input coordinates are non-negative integers.\n\n### Output\n\nYou are to submit 10 output files corresponding to the given input files which describe the required polygons $A$ and $B$. The first line is to contain the text:\n\n```\n#FILE polygon I\n```\n\nwhere integer $I$ ($1 \\leq I \\leq 10$) is the number of the respective input file.\n\nThe output format is similar to the input format. The second line is to contain one integer $N_A$: the number of vertices in $A$ ($2 \\leq N_A \\leq 4$). The following $N_A$ lines describe the vertices of $A$ in the counter-clockwise order, one vertex per line. Line $N_A+2$ (for $i = 1, 2, \\dots, N_A$) contains two integers $X$ and $Y$, separated by a space: coordinates of the $i$th vertex of the polygon $A$.\n\nLine $N_A+3$ should contain one integer $N_B$: the number of vertices in $B$ ($2 \\leq N_B$). The following $N_B$ lines describe the vertices of $B$ in the counter-clockwise order, one vertex per line. Line $N_A+J+3$ (for $j = 1, 2, \\dots, N_B$) contains two integers $X$ and $Y$, separated by a space: coordinates of the $j$th vertex of the polygon $B$.\n\n### Example Input and Outputs\n\n`polygon0.in`\n\n```\n5\n0 1\n0 0\n2 0\n2 1\n1 2\n```\n\nFor the above input, either of the below output files (see also the figures) is correct, since in both cases $A$ is a triangle and it cannot be a quadrilateral.\n\n`#FILE polygon 0`\n\n```\n3\n0 0\n2 0\n1 1\n2\n0 1\n0 0\n```\n\n`#FILE polygon 0`\n\n```\n3\n0 0\n0 1\n1 3\n2\n0 1\n0 0\n```\n\n![<image>](example_polygon_output.png)\n\nDo note that you DO NOT necessarily have to solve for the general case, but only for the subproblem defined by the following constraints:",

    "input": "## Description\n\nBeggar Thy Neighbour is a card game taught to me by my parents when I was a small child, and is a game I like to play with my young kids today.\n\nIn this kata you will be given two player hands to be played.  And must return the index of the player who will win.\n\n## Rules of the game\n\n- Special cards are: Jacks, Queens, Kings and Aces\n- The object of the game is to win all the cards.\n- Any player that cannot play a card is out of the game.\n\nTo start:\n\n- The 52 cards in a standard deck are shuffled.\n- The cards are dealt equally between all players.\n\nTo play:\n\n- The first player turns over and plays the top card from their hand into a common pile.\n- If the card is not special - then the second player plays their next card onto the pile, and play continues back to the first player.\n- If the card is a Jack, Queen, King or Ace, the other player must play 1, 2, 3 or 4 penalty cards respectively.\n- If no special cards are played during a penalty, then the player that played the special card, takes the common pile.\n- If a special card is played during a penalty, then the penalty moves back to the previous player immediately with the size of the new penalty defined by the new special card.  It is possible for this process to repeat several times in one play.  Whoever played the last special card, wins the common pile.\n- The winner of the common pile, places it on the bottom of their hand, and then starts the next common pile.\n\nIt is theorised that an initial deal may never end, though so far all of my games have ended!  For that reason, if 10,000 cards are played and no one has won, return `None`.\n\n## Card Encoding\n\nCards are represented with a two character code.  The first characater will be one of A23456789TJQK representing Ace, 2 though 9, Ten, Jack, Queen, King respectively.  The second character is the suit, 'S', 'H', 'C', or 'D' representing Spades, Hearts, Clubs and Diamonds respectively.  \n\nFor example a hand of `[\"TD\", \"AC\", \"5H\"]` would represent 10 of Diamonds, Ace of Clubs, and 5 of hearts.\n\n## Mini Example Game\n\nGiven the following hands:\n\n`Player 1: [9C, JC, 2H, QC], Player 2: [TD, JH, 6H, 9S]`\n\nPlay would flow as follows:\n\n```\nStart   - P1: [9C, JC, 2H, QC],   P2: [TD, JH, 6H, 9S],           Common: []\nTurn  1 - P1: [JC, 2H, QC],       P2: [TD, JH, 6H, 9S],           Common: [9C]\nTurn  2 - P1: [JC, 2H, QC],       P2: [JH, 6H, 9S],               Common: [9C, TD]\nTurn  3 - P1: [2H, QC],           P2: [JH, 6H, 9S],               Common: [9C, TD, JC]\n```\nPlayer 1 plays a Jack, player 2 pays 1 penalty\n```\nTurn  4 - P1: [2H, QC],           P2: [6H, 9S],                   Common: [9C, TD, JC, JH]\n```\nPlayer 2 plays a Jack, player 1 pays 1 penalty\n```\nTurn  5 - P1: [QC],               P2: [6H, 9S],                   Common: [9C, TD, JC, JH, 2H]\n```\nPlayer 2 wins the common pool and starts the next game\n```\nTurn  6 - P1: [QC],               P2: [9S, 9C, TD, JC, JH, 2H],   Common: [6H]\nTurn  7 - P1: [],                 P2: [9S, 9C, TD, JC, JH, 2H],   Common: [6H, QC]\n```\nPlayer 1 plays a Queen, player 2 pays 2 penalties\n```\nTurn  8 - P1: [],                 P2: [9C, TD, JC, JH, 2H],       Common: [6H, QC, 9S]\nTurn  9 - P1: [],                 P2: [TD, JC, JH, 2H],           Common: [6H, QC, 9S, 9C]\n```\nPlayer 1 wins the common pool and starts the next game\n```\nTurn 10 - P1: [QC, 9S, 9C],       P2: [TD, JC, JH, 2H],           Common: [6H]\n\n```\nAnd so on... with player 2 eventually winning.\n\n\nGood luck!",

    "input": "## Problem\n\nFamous ancient Greek sculptor Phidias is making preparations to build another marvelous monument. For this purpose he needs rectangular marble plates of sizes $W_1 \\times H_1$, $W_2 \\times H_2$, ..., $W_N \\times H_N$.\n\nRecently, Phidias has received a large rectangular marble slab. He wants to cut the slab to obtain plates of the desired sizes. Any piece of marble (the slab or the plates cut from it) can be cut either horizontally or vertically into two rectangular plates with integral widths and heights, cutting completely through that piece. This is the only way to cut pieces and pieces cannot be joined together. Since the marble has a pattern on it, the plates cannot be rotated: if Phidias cuts a plate of size $A \\times B$ then it cannot be used as a plate of size $B \\times A$ unless $A = B$. He can make zero or more plates of each desired size. A marble plate is wasted if it is not of any of the desired sizes after all cuts are completed. Phidias wonders how to cut the initial slab so that as little of it as possible will be wasted.\n\nAs an example, assume that in the figure below the width of the original slab is 21 and the height of the original slab is 11, and the desired plate sizes are $10 \\times 4$, $6 \\times 2$, $7 \\times 5$, and $15 \\times 10$. The minimum possible area wasted is 10, and the figure shows one sequence of cuts with total waste area of size 10.\n\n<center>\n<image>\n</center>\n\nYour task is to write a program that, given the size of the original slab and the desired plate sizes, calculates the minimum total area of the original slab that must be wasted.\n\n## Input\n\nThe input file name is `phidias.in`. The first line of input contains two integers: first $W$, the width of the original slab, and then $H$, the height of the original slab. The second line contains one integer $N$: the number of desired plate sizes. The following $N$ lines contain the desired plate sizes. Each of these lines contains two integers: first the width $W_i$ and then the height $H_i$ of that desired plate size ($1 \\leq i \\leq N$).\n\n## Output\n\nThe output file name is `phidias.out`. The file is to contain one line with a single integer: the minimum total area of the original slab that must be wasted.\n\n## Example Inputs and Outputs\n\n| `phidias.in` | `phidias.out` |\n|--------------|---------------|\n| 21 11        | 10            |\n| 4            |               |\n| 10 4         |               |\n| 6 2          |               |\n| 7 5          |               |\n| 15 10        |               |\n\n## Constraints\n\nIn all inputs, $1 \\leq W \\leq 600$, $1 \\leq H \\leq 600$, $0 < N \\leq 200$, $1 \\leq W_i \\leq W$, and $1 \\leq H_i \\leq H$.

    "input": "## Task: BIR \\ Birthday\n\n### Day 2. Source file `bir.*`\n**Available memory:** 32 MB.   **Maximum running time:** 2 s.\n\nIt is Byteman's birthday today. There are \\( n \\) children at his birthday party (including Byteman). The children are numbered from \\( 1 \\) to \\( n \\). Byteman's parents have prepared a big round table and they have placed \\( n \\) chairs around the table. When the children arrive, they take seats. The child number \\( 1 \\) takes one of the seats. Then the child number \\( 2 \\) takes the seat on the left. Then the child number \\( 3 \\) takes the next seat on the left, and so on. Finally, the child number \\( n \\) takes the last free seat, between the children number \\( 1 \\) and \\( n-1 \\).\n\nByteman's parents know the children very well and they know that some of the children will be noisy, if they sit too close to each other. Therefore the parents are going to reseat the children in a specific order. Such an order can be described by a permutation \\( p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n \\) (\\( p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n \\) are distinct integers from \\( 1 \\) to \\( n \\)) — child \\( p_1 \\) should sit between \\( p_n \\) and \\( p_2 \\), child \\( p_i \\) (for \\( i = 2, 3, \\ldots, n-1 \\)) should sit between \\( p_{i-1} \\) and \\( p_{i+1} \\), and child \\( p_n \\) should sit between \\( p_{n-1} \\) and \\( p_1 \\). Please note, that child \\( p_1 \\) can sit on the left or on the right from child \\( p_n \\).\n\nTo seat all the children in the given order, the parents must move each child around the table to the left or to the right some number of seats. For each child, they must decide how the child will move — that is, they must choose a direction of movement (left or right) and distance (number of seats). On the given signal, all the children stand up at once, move to the proper places and sit down.\n\nThe reseating procedure throws the birthday party into a mess. The mess is equal to the largest distance any child moves. The children can be reseated in many ways. The parents choose one with minimum mess. Help them to find such a way to reseat the children.\n\n### Task\nYour task is to write a program that:\n- reads from the standard input the number of the children and the permutation describing the desired order of the children,\n- determines the minimum possible mess,\n- writes the result to the standard output.\n\n### Input\nThe first line of standard input contains one integer \\( n \\) (\\( 1 \\leq n \\leq 1,000,000 \\)). The second line contains \\( n \\) integers \\( p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n \\), separated by single spaces. Numbers \\( p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n \\) form a permutation of the set \\( \\{ 1, 2, \\ldots, n \\} \\) describing the desired order of the children. Additionally, in 50% of the test cases, \\( n \\) will not exceed \\( 1,000 \\).\n\n### Output\nThe first and the only line of standard output should contain one integer: the minimum possible mess.\n\n### Example\n\n**Input:**\n```\n6\n3 4 5 1 2 6\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n2\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n![example_circles](<image>)\n\nThe left figure shows the initial arrangement of the children. The middle figure shows the result of the following reseating: children number \\( 1 \\) and \\( 2 \\) move one place, children number \\( 3 \\) and \\( 5 \\) move two places, and children number \\( 4 \\) and \\( 6 \\) do not change places. The conditions of arrangement are fulfilled, since \\( 3 \\) sits between \\( 6 \\) and \\( 4 \\), \\( 4 \\) sits between \\( 3 \\) and \\( 5 \\), \\( 5 \\) sits between \\( 4 \\) and \\( 1 \\), \\( 1 \\) sits between \\( 5 \\) and \\( 2 \\), \\( 2 \\) sits between \\( 1 \\) and \\( 6 \\), and \\( 6 \\) sits between \\( 2 \\) and \\( 3 \\). There exists another possible final arrangement of children, depicted in the right figure. In both cases no child moves more than two seats.\n\nDo note that you DO NOT necessarily have to solve for the general case, but only for the subproblem defined by the following constraints:",

Then $b_i$ is equal exactly to the minimum among values $a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, \\ldots, a_{i,m}$ and $g_j$ is equal exactly to the maximum among values $b_{1,j}, b_{2,j}, \\ldots, b_{n,j}$.\n\nYou are interested in the minimum total number of sweets that boys could present, so you need to minimize the sum of $a_{i,j}$ for all $(i,j)$ such that $1 \\leq i \\leq n$ and $1 \\leq j \\leq m$.
